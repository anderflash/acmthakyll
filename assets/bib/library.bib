abstract = {A revis\~{a}o bibliogr\'{a}fica sistem\'{a}tica \'{e} um m\'{e}todo cient\'{\i}fico para busca e an\'{a}lise de artigos de uma determinada \'{a}rea da ci\^{e}ncia. \'{E} amplamente utilizada em pesquisas na medicina, psicologia e ci\^{e}ncias sociais, onde h\'{a} grandes massas de dados e fontes de informa\c{c}\~{o}es. Pesquisas na \'{a}rea de gest\~{a}o de opera\c{c}\~{o}es tamb\'{e}m necessitam analisar crescentes quantidades de artigos e informa\c{c}\~{o}es. No entanto, t\'{e}cnicas de revis\~{a}o sistem\'{a}tica s\~{a}o pouco difundidas nessa \'{a}rea, em especial em desenvolvimento de produtos e gerenciamento de projetos. O objetivo desse artigo \'{e} apresentar um roteiro para a condu\c{c}\~{a}o de revis\~{a}o bibliogr\'{a}fica sistem\'{a}tica (RBS) na \'{a}rea de gest\~{a}o de opera\c{c}\~{o}es com foco em pesquisas nos temas “desenvolvimento de produtos” e “gerenciamento de projetos”. O roteiro foi intitulado RBS Roadmap e foi criado a partir das melhores pr\'{a}ticas preconizadas em \'{a}reas pioneiras nesse tipo revis\~{a}o, combinada com uma pesquisa-a\c{c}\~{a}o em tr\^{e}s pesquisas na \'{a}rea de gest\~{a}o de opera\c{c}\~{o}es. A principal contribui\c{c}\~{a}o para a teoria e pr\'{a}tica \'{e} a sistematiza\c{c}\~{a}o do procedimento para revis\~{a}o sistem\'{a}tica voltado especificamente para pesquisas na \'{a}rea de desenvolvimento de produtos e gerenciamento de projetos, que pode ser utilizado como refer\^{e}ncia para pesquisadores nessa \'{a}rea.},

abstract = {We present an algorithm that simultaneously calibrates two color cameras, a depth camera, and the relative pose between them. The method is designed to have three key features: accurate, practical, and applicable to a wide range of sensors. The method requires only a planar surface to be imaged from various poses. The calibration does not use depth discontinuities in the depth image, which makes it flexible and robust to noise. We apply this calibration to a Kinect device and present a new depth distortion model for the depth sensor. We perform experiments that show an improved accuracy with respect to the manufacturer's calibration.},

abstract = {Architectural sketching and massing are used by designers to analyze and explore the design space of buildings. This paper describes a novel multi-touch interface for fast architectural sketching and massing of tall buildings. It incorporates a family of multi-touch gestures, enabling one to quickly sketch the 2D contour of a base floor plan and extrude it to model a building with multi-floor structures. Further, it provides a set of gestures to users: select and edit a range of floors; scale contours of a building; copy, paste, and rotate a building, i.e., create a twisted structure; edit profile curves of a building's profile; and collapse and remove a selected range of floors. The multi-touch system also allows users to apply textures or geometric facades to the building, and to compare different designs side-by-side. To guide the design process, we describe interactions with a domain expert, a practicing architect. The final interface is evaluated by architects and students in an architecture Dept., which demonstrates that the system allows rapid conceptual design and massing of novel multi-story building structures.},

abstract = {The previous chapter has investigated how measurements can be taken on planar surfaces from uncalibrated images. However, the world is not just one big plane (as Cristoforo Colombo discovered five centuries ago); it is a complex three-dimensional structure. Therefore, a more general analysis of the threedimensional scene is required; this is achieved in this chapter. In particular, this chapter describes how aspects of the affine three-dimensional geometry of a scene may be measured from a single perspective image (see also [25, 26, 28]). The techniques described still concentrate on scenes containing planes and parallel lines, although the methods are not so restricted. The algorithms developed here extend and generalize previous results on single-view metrology [59, 68, 96, 100].},

This chapter presents a framework for thinking about attention that facilitates the analysis of this cognitive process in terms of underlying neural mechanisms. Four processes are fundamental to attention: working memory, top-down sensitivity control, competitive selection, and automatic bottom-up filtering for salient stimuli. Each process makes a distinct and essential contribution to attention. Voluntary control of attention involves the first three processes (working memory, top-down sensitivity control, and competitive selection) operating in a recurrent loop. Recent results from neurobiological research on attention are discussed within this framework.},

abstract = {The problem of robust, realistic and especially fast 3-D reconstruction of objects, although extensively studied, is still a challenging research task. Most of the state-of-the-art approaches that target real-time applications, such as immersive reality, address mainly the problem of synthesizing intermediate views for given view-points, rather than generating a single complete 3-D surface. In this paper, we present a multiple-Kinect capturing system and a novel methodology for the creation of accurate, realistic, full 3-D reconstructions of moving foreground objects, e.g., humans, to be exploited in real-time applications. The proposed method generates multiple textured meshes from multiple RGB-Depth streams, applies a coarse-to-fine registration algorithm and finally merges the separate meshes into a single 3-D surface. Although the Kinect sensor has attracted the attention of many researchers and home enthusiasts and has already appeared in many applications over the Internet, none of the already presented works can produce full 3-D models of moving objects from multiple Kinect streams in real-time. We present the capturing setup, the methodology for its calibration and the details of the proposed algorithm for real-time fusion of multiple meshes. The presented experimental results verify the effectiveness of the approach with respect to the 3-D reconstruction quality, as well as the achieved frame rates.},

Our method makes use of a smooth template that provides a crude approximation of the scanned object and serves as a geometric and topological prior for reconstruction. Large-scale motion of the acquired object is recovered using a novel space-time adaptive, non-rigid registration method. Fine-scale details such as wrinkles and folds are synthesized with an efficient linear mesh deformation algorithm. Subsequent spatial and temporal filtering of detail coefficients allows transfer of persistent geometric detail to regions not observed by the scanner. We show how this two-scale process allows faithful recovery of small-scale shape and motion features leading to a high-quality reconstruction. We illustrate the robustness and generality of our algorithm on a variety of examples composed of different materials and exhibiting a large range of dynamic deformations.},

abstract = {Designing interactive learning environments (ILEs; e.g., intelligent tutoring systems, educational games, etc.) is a challenging interdisciplinary process that needs to satisfy multiple stakeholders. ILEs need to function in real educational settings (e.g., schools) in which a number of goals interact. Several instructional design methodologies exist to help developers address these goals. However, they often lead to conflicting recommendations. Due to the lack of an established methodology to resolve such conflicts, developers of ILEs have to rely on ad-hoc solutions. We present a principled methodology to resolve such conflicts. We build on a well-established design process for creating Cognitive Tutors, a highly effective type of ILE. We extend this process by integrating methods from multiple disciplines to resolve design conflicts. We illustrate our methodology's effectiveness by describing the iterative development of the Fractions Tutor, which has proven to be effective in classroom studies with 3,000 4th-6th graders.},

abstract = {When you share content in an online social network, who is listening? Users have scarce information about who actually sees their content, making their audience seem invisible and difficult to estimate. However, understanding this invisible audience can impact both science and design, since perceived audiences influence content production and self-presentation online. In this paper, we combine survey and large-scale log data to examine how well users' perceptions of their audience match their actual audience on Facebook. We find that social media users consistently underestimate their audience size for their posts, guessing that their audience is just 27\% of its true size. Qualitative coding of survey responses reveals folk theories that attempt to reverse-engineer audience size using feedback and friend count, though none of these approaches are particularly accurate. We analyze audience logs for 222,000 Facebook users' posts over the course of one month and find that publicly visible signals --- friend count, likes, and comments --- vary widely and do not strongly indicate the audience of a single post. Despite the variation, users typically reach 61\% of their friends each month. Together, our results begin to reveal the invisible undercurrents of audience attention and behavior in online social networks.},

This paper investigates the relationship between such characteristics and fine-grained user attention patterns. In particular, we present results from an eye tracking user study involving bar graphs and radar graphs, showing that a user's cognitive abilities such as perceptual speed and verbal working memory have a significant impact on gaze behavior, both in general and in relation to task difficulty and visualization type. These results are discussed in view of our long-term goal of designing information visualisation systems that can dynamically adapt to individual user characteristics.},

abstract = {The growing use of social media means that an increasing amount of people's lives are visible online. We draw from Goffman's theatrical metaphor and Hogan's exhibition approach to explore how people manage their personal collection of social media data over time. We conducted a qualitative study of 13 participants to reveal their day-to-day decision-making about producing and curating digital traces on Facebook. Their goals and strategies showed that people experience the Facebook platform as consisting of three different functional regions: a performance region for managing recent data and impression management, an exhibition region for longer term presentation of self-image, and a personal region for archiving meaningful facets of life. Further, users' need for presenting and archiving data in these three regions is mediated by temporality. These findings trigger a discussion of how to design social media that support these dynamic and sometimes conflicting needs.},

abstract = {The field of Educational Games has seen many calls for added rigor. One avenue for improving the rigor of the field is developing more generalizable methods for measuring student learning within games. Throughout the process of development, what is relevant to measure and assess may change as a game evolves into a finished product. The field needs an approach for game developers and researchers to be able to prototype and experiment with different measures that can stand up to rigorous scrutiny, as well as provide insight into possible new directions for development. We demonstrate a toolkit and analysis tools that capture and analyze students' performance within open educational games. The system records relevant events during play, which can be used for analysis of player learning by designers. The tools support replaying student sessions within the original game's environment, which allows researchers and developers to explore possible explanations for student behavior. Using this system, we were able to facilitate a number of analyses of student learning in an open educational game developed by a team of our collaborators as well as gain greater insight into student learning with the game and where to focus as we iterate.},

abstract = {The term systematic review is used to refer to a specific methodology of research, developed in order to gather and evaluate the available evidence pertaining to a focused topic. It represents a secondary study that depends on primary study results to be accomplished. Several primary studies have been conducted in the field of Software Engineering in the last years, determining an increasing improvement in methodology. However, in most cases software is built with technologies and processes for which developers have insufficient evidence to confirm their suitability, limits, qualities, costs, and inherent risks. Conducting systematic reviews in Software Engineering consists in a major methodological tool to scientifically improve the validity of assertions that can be made in the field and, as a consequence, the reliability degree of the methods that are employed for developing software technologies and supporting software processes. This paper aims at discussing the significance of experimental studies, particularly systematic reviews, and their use in supporting software processes. A template designed to support systematic reviews in Software Engineering is presented, and the development of ontologies to describe knowledge regarding such experimental studies is also introduced.},

abstract = {Collaborative modeling and simulation take strong advantage of resource sharing across the Internet for an extended enterprise or a virtual enterprise. Collaborative graphical modeling is more attractive, but also more difficult, when applied on the World Wide Web. One solution for integrating 2D graphical modeling and a Web-based online analyzer is discussed, and a prototype is realized through a campus network. An order management model is designed collaboratively using the EXTEND modeling tool to map the operations involved in the scheduling, production and transportation of a geographically distributed iron-ore enterprise. The distributed managers can submit orders and then obtain the simulation results online from a Web online analyzer which is realized by an Apache Web server, PHP and mySQL tools. The prototype shows effective experimental results. It is intended to study the system further in creating a complete model base for a simulation server and a graphical user interface for browsers},

We give a set of algebraic constraints satisfied by the 27 coefficients of the trifocal tensor which allow to parameterize it minimally with 18 coefficients. We then describe a robust method for estimating the trifocal tensor from point and line correspondences that uses this minimal parameterization.

We conducted a user study to record eye movements of four participants over a full day of their daily life, totalling 42.5 hours of eye movement data. Participants were asked to self-annotate four non-mutually exclusive cues: social (interacting with somebody vs. no interaction), cognitive (concentrated work vs. leisure), physical (physically active vs. not active), and spatial (inside vs. outside a building). We evaluate a proof-of-concept EyeContext system that combines encoding of eye movements into strings and a spectrum string kernel support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Our results demonstrate the large information content available in long-term human visual behaviour and opens up new venues for research on eye-based behavioural monitoring and life logging.},

To assist people to lift medium-weight objects without a complex structure or various costs, we focus on the phenomenon that our weight perception during handling objects is affected by visual properties. Our hypothesis is that this illusionary effect in weight perception can be applied to reduce fatigue while handling medium-weight objects without mechatronics-based physical assistance. In this paper, we propose an augmented reality system that changes the brightness value of an object in order to reduce fatigue while handling the object. We conducted two fundamental experiments to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed system. Our results suggested that the system eliminates the need to use excess energy for handling objects and reduces fatigue during the handling task.},

@article{Hermens2010,
abstract = {When making a saccadic eye movement to a peripheral target, a simultaneous stimulus onset at central fixation generally increases saccadic latency, while offsets reduce latency ('gap effect'). Visual onsets remote from fixation also increase latency ('remote distractor effect'); however, the influence of remote visual offsets is less clear. Previous studies, which used a search task, found that remote offsets either facilitated, inhibited, or did nothing to saccade latencies towards a peripheral target. It cannot be excluded, however, that the target selection process in such search tasks influenced the results. We therefore simplified the task and asked participants to make eye movements to a predictable target. Simultaneously with target onset, either one or multiple remote stimulus onsets and offsets were presented. It was found that peripheral onsets increased saccade latencies, but offsets did not influence the initiation of a saccade to the target. Moreover, the number of onsets and offsets did not affect the results. These results suggest that earlier effects of remote stimulus offsets and of the number of remote distractor onsets reside in the target identification process of the visual search task rather than the competition between possible saccade goals. The results are discussed in the context of models of saccade target selection.},

Lack of visual understanding about a simulated model is one of the major reasons inhibiting contractors and engineers from using results obtained from discrete-event simulation to plan and design their construction processes and commit real resources on the job site. The fast emerging information technology makes the use of modern visualization applications more appealing to engineers and scientists in different domains. This paper presents the design and implementation of an augmented reality (AR) visualization application together with an authoring language that allows the creation of outdoor AR animated scenes of simulated operations while featuring complete user involvement and interaction. The application is based on the concept of scene graphs. It also uses a unique general purpose data transmission method to communicate with hardware components of the system.},

abstract = {Despite the apparent popularity of touchscreens for older adults, little is known about the psychomotor performance of these devices. We compared performance between older adults and younger adults on four desktop and touchscreen tasks: pointing, dragging, crossing and steering. On the touchscreen, we also examined pinch-to-zoom. Our results show that while older adults were significantly slower than younger adults in general, the touchscreen reduced this performance gap relative to the desktop and mouse. Indeed, the touchscreen resulted in a significant movement time reduction of 35\% over the mouse for older adults, compared to only 16\% for younger adults. Error rates also decreased.},

abstract = {This paper presents IUCA (Interaction Using Camera Animations), a new interaction technique for 3D objects manipulation. IUCA allows efficient interaction in a full-resolution perspective view by integrating transients animated transitions to orthographic views into the manipulation task. This provides an interaction in context, with precise object positioning and alignment. An evaluation of the technique shows that, compared to the classical configurations, IUCA allows to reduce pointing time by 14\% on average. Testing with professional 3D designers and novice users indicate that IUCA is easy to use and to learn; and that users feel comfortable with it.},

abstract = {This paper presents a method of estimating camera pose in an unknown scene. While this has previously been attempted by adapting SLAM algorithms developed for robotic exploration, we propose a system specifically designed to track a hand-held camera in a small AR workspace. We propose to split tracking and mapping into two separate tasks, processed in parallel threads on a dual-core computer: one thread deals with the task of robustly tracking erratic hand-held motion, while the other produces a 3D map of point features from previously observed video frames. This allows the use of computationally expensive batch optimisation techniques not usually associated with real-time operation: The result is a system that produces detailed maps with thousands of landmarks which can be tracked at frame-rate, with an accuracy and robustness rivalling that of state-of-the-art model-based systems.},

The first experiment used targets at fixed depths. Results indicate that one-eyed cursors only improve screen-plane pointing techniques, and that constant target depth does not influence pointing throughput. A second experiment included pointing between targets at varying depths and used only "screen-plane" pointing techniques. Our results suggest that in the absence of stereo cue conflicts, screen-space projections of Fitts' law parameters (target size and distance) yield constant throughput despite target depth differences and produce better models of performance.},

Activities of Internet Company are described by pi-calculus processes and a Petri net which are derived from system requirements in a bottom-up way and a top-down way using the homotopy lifting property and the homotopy extension property. Entities in both properties are specified by the incrementally modular abstraction hierarchy by climbing down the abstraction hierarchy from the most abstract homotopy level to the most specific view level, while keeping invariants such as homotopy equivalence or topological equivalence.},

abstract = {The process of teaching-learning based on lessons spoken-exposed, having the blackboard as the main didactic resource, does not currently brings attractiveness consistent and coherent with the environment in which elementary school students are involved with, full of technologies and innovations. Computers had and have a decisive role in changing this scenario. They had in education three generations, and the fourth generation begins to emerge with Virtual Reality (VR). The way of learning depends upon each person, some learn visually, other verbally, some explore and other deduct. An example of learning object that requires the student to make an abstraction or mentally to create a model for understanding is a three physiology. This area of knowledge covers the anatomy of plants, which can not only be taught with the use of traditional tools of education, since it presents complexity and dynamic ways that can only be viewed through simulations. In this context, the Augmented Reality (AR) fits as a tool for viewing, interaction and involvement with objects of learning. The purpose of this paper is to present an architecture for distribution of virtual environments of AR as a tool to support projects in education. A cognitive interface has been created to allow AR user interaction with a virtual environment through interaction menus and also through real markers. With this implementation, the interactions made in an virtual environment are replicated for other environments, creating a system strongly applied to support education, since it provides multiple views of virtual objects. It is understood that when one distributes the interactions made, users can make cooperate in an AR environment, enabling a greater level of understanding for the taught subject.},

abstract = {Standard presentation systems consisting of a laptop connected to a projector suffer from two problems: (1) the projected image appears distorted (keystoned) unless the projector is precisely aligned to the projection screen; (2) the speaker is forced to interact with the computer rather than the audience. This paper shows how the addition of an uncalibrated camera, aimed at the screen, solves both problems. Although the locations, orientations and optical parameters of the camera and projector are unknown, the projector-camera system calibrates itself by exploiting the homography between the projected slide and the camera image. Significant improvements are possible over passively calibrating systems since the projector actively manipulates the environment by placing feature points into the scene. For instance, using a low-resolution (160×120) camera, we can achieve an accuracy of ±3 pixels in a 1024×768 presentation slide. The camera-projector system infers models for the projector-to-camera and projector-to-screen mappings in order to provide two major benefits},

abstract = {The authors present a fast electronic image stabilization system that compensates for 3D rotation. The extended Kalman filter framework is employed to estimate the rotation between frames, which is represented using unit quaternions. A small set of automatically selected and tracked feature points are used as measurements. The effectiveness of this technique is also demonstrated by constructing mosaic images from the motion estimates, and comparing them to mosaics built from 2D stabilization algorithms. Two different stabilization schemes are presented. The first, implemented in a real-time platform based on a Datacube MV200 board, estimates the motion between two consecutive frames and is able to process gray level images of resolution 128×120 at 10 Hz. The second scheme estimates the motion between the current frame and an inverse mosaic; this allows better estimation without the need for indexing the new image frames. Experimental results for both schemes using real and synthetic image sequences are presented},

abstract = {This paper presents the results from surveying simulation practitioners from industry and academics who have used 2D or 3D software applications for discrete event simulation (DES) projects. The survey focused on the impacts of virtual reality (VR) on DES activities. The findings indicate the software used, the applications areas, the stages in the simulation modeling process where visual display is commonly used, and a comparative evaluation of the benefits and costs associated with modeling in 3D over 2D. Other results indicate possible influence of each of the two displays on simulation results, effects on users' understanding of the modeled system and any corresponding influence on decision making. The findings also incorporate the pitfalls to avoid when modeling in 3D, and speculations about the future of VR-based DES (VRSIM) practice.},

abstract = {Virtual reality (VR) has long been hampered by the gear needed to make the experience possible; specifically, stereo glasses and tracking devices. Autostereoscopic display devices are gaining popularity by freeing the user from stereo glasses, however few qualify as VR displays. The Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) has designed and produced a large scale, high resolution head-tracked barrier-strip autostereoscopic display system that produces a VR immersive experience without requiring the user to wear any encumbrances. The resulting system, called Varrier, is a passive parallax barrier 35-panel tiled display that produces a wide field of view, head-tracked VR experience. This paper presents background material related to parallax barrier autostereoscopy, provides system configuration and construction details, examines Varrier interleaving algorithms used to produce the stereo images, introduces calibration and testing, and discusses the camera-based tracking subsystem.},

abstract = {Instant access to computing, when and where we need it, has long been one of the aims of research areas such as ubiquitous computing. In this paper, we describe the WorldKit system, which makes use of a paired depth camera and projector to make ordinary surfaces instantly interactive. Using this system, touch-based interactivity can, without prior calibration, be placed on nearly any unmodified surface literally with a wave of the hand, as can other new forms of sensed interaction. From a user perspective, such interfaces are easy enough to instantiate that they could, if desired, be recreated or modified "each time we sat down" by "painting" them next to us. From the programmer's perspective, our system encapsulates these capabilities in a simple set of abstractions that make the creation of interfaces quick and easy. Further, it is extensible to new, custom interactors in a way that closely mimics conventional 2D graphical user interfaces, hiding much of the complexity of working in this new domain. We detail the hardware and software implementation of our system, and several example applications built using the library.},

@book{opencv,
annote = {"This library is useful for practitioners, and is an excellent tool for those entering the field: it is a set of computer vision algorithms that work as advertised."
-William T. Freeman, Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
        
Learning OpenCV puts you in the middle of the rapidly expanding field of computer vision. Written by the creators of the free open source OpenCV library, this book introduces you to computer vision and demonstrates how you can quickly build applications that enable computers to "see" and make decisions based on that data. 
        
Computer vision is everywhere-in security systems, manufacturing inspection systems, medical image analysis, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, and more. It stitches Google maps and Google Earth together, checks the pixels on LCD screens, and makes sure the stitches in your shirt are sewn properly. OpenCV provides an easy-to-use computer vision framework and a comprehensive library with more than 500 functions that can run vision code in real time. 
        
Learning OpenCV will teach any developer or hobbyist to use the framework quickly with the help of hands-on exercises in each chapter. This book includes:
A thorough introduction to OpenCV
Getting input from cameras
Transforming images
Segmenting images and shape matching
Pattern recognition, including face detection
Tracking and motion in 2 and 3 dimensions
3D reconstruction from stereo vision
Machine learning algorithms
Getting machines to see is a challenging but entertaining goal. Whether you want to build simple or sophisticated vision applications, Learning OpenCV is the book you need to get started.

abstract = {We present a geometric method for (i) matching 2D line segments from multiple oriented images, (ii) optimally reconstructing 3D line segments and (iii) grouping 3D line segments to corners. The proposed algorithm uses two developments in combining projective geometry and statistics, which are described in this article: (i) the geometric entities points, lines and planes in 2D and 3D and their uncertainty are represented in homogeneous coordinates and new entities may be constructed including their propagated uncertainty. The construction can be performed directly or as an estimation. (ii) relations such as incidence, equality, parallelism and orthogonality between points, lines and planes can be tested statistically based on a given significance level. Using these tools, the resulting algorithm is straightforward and gives reasonable results. It is only based on geometric information and does not use any image intensities, though it can be extended to use other information. The matching of 3D lines does not need any thresholds other than a significance value for the hypotheses tests.},

abstract = {. Skilled (n = 12) and less skilled (n = 12) billiards players participated in 2 experiments in which the relationship between quiet eye duration, expertise, and task complexity was examined in a near and a far aiming task. Quiet eye was defined as the final fixation on the target prior to the initiation of movement. In Experiment 1, skilled performers exhibited longer fixations on the target (quiet eye) during the preparation phase of the action than their less skilled counterparts did. Quiet eye duration increased as a function of shot difficulty and was proportionally longer on successful than on unsuccessful shots for both groups of participants. In Experiment 2, participants executed shots under 3 different time-constrained conditions in which quiet eye periods were experimentally manipulated. Shorter quiet eye periods resulted in poorer performance, irrespective of participant skill level. The authors argue that quiet eye duration represents a critical period for movement programming in the aiming response.},

@book{McPherson2001,
abstract = {This book describes the basis, application, and interpretation of statistics, and presents a wide range of univariate and multivariate statistical methodology. In its first edition it has proved popular across all science and technology based disciplines, including the social sciences, and in areas of commerce. It is used both as a reference on statistical methodology for researchers and technicians, and as a textbook with particular appeal for graduate classes containing students of mixed mathematical and statistical background. The book is developed without the use of calculus, although several self-contained sections containing calculus are included to provide additional insight for readers who have a calculus background. Based on the author's "Statistics in Scientific Investigation," the book has been extended substantially in the area of multivariate applications and through the expansion of logistic regression and log linear methodology. It presumes readers have access to a statistical computing package and includes guidance on the application of statistical computing packages. The new edition retains the unique feature of being written from the users' perspective; it connects statistical models and methods to investigative questions and background information, and connects statistical results with interpretations in plain English. In keeping with this approach, methods are grouped by usage rather than by commonality of statistical methodology. Guidance is provided on the choice of appropriate methods. The use of real life examples has been retained and expanded. Using the power of the Internet, expanded reports on the examples are available at a Springer Web site as Word documents. Additionaly, all data sets are available at the Web site as Excel files, and program files and data sets are provided for SAS users and SPSS users. The programs are annotated so users can adapt for their own data sets. Glen McPherson has had a long career as an acedmic and a consultant in applied statistics. After holding a tenured position for thirty years at The University of Tasmania in Australia, where he developed and directed under-graduate and gradate programs in applied statistics, he resigned to devote more time to book writing and to his consultancy role to government, business, and industry. The practical experience built into the book is drawn from the two thousand consulantcies he has undetaken across virtually all areas in which statistics has an application.},

abstract = {In this paper we investigate the challenge of 3D reconstruction from Snooker video data. We propose a system pipeline for intelligent filtering based on semantic importance in Snooker. The system can be divided into table detection and correction, followed by ball detection, classification and tracking. It is apparent from previous work that there are several challenges presented here. Firstly, previous methods tend to use a fixed top-down camera mounted above the table. To capture a full table view from this is challenging due to space limitations above the table. Instead, we capture video data from a tripod and correct the viewpoint through processing. Secondly, previous methods tend to simply detect the balls without considering other interfering objects such as player and cue. This becomes even more apparent when the player strikes the cue ball. Our intelligent filtering avoids such issues to give accurate 3D table reconstruction.},

@article{Peterka2008,
abstract = {A solid-state dynamic parallax barrier autostereoscopic display mitigates some of the restrictions present in static barrier systems, such as fixed view-distance range, slow response to head movements, and fixed stereo operating mode. By dynamically varying barrier parameters in real time, viewers may move closer to the display and move faster laterally than with a static barrier system, and the display can switch between 3D and 2D modes by disabling the barrier on a per-pixel basis. Moreover, Dynallax can output four independent eye channels when two viewers are present, and both head-tracked viewers receive an independent pair of left-eye and right-eye perspective views based on their position in 3D space. The display device is constructed by using a dual-stacked LCD monitor where a dynamic barrier is rendered on the front display and a modulated virtual environment composed of two or four channels is rendered on the rear display. Dynallax was recently demonstrated in a small-scale head-tracked prototype system. This paper summarizes the concepts presented earlier, extends the discussion of various topics, and presents recent improvements to the system.},

@article{Szeliski2004,
abstract = {A new approach to computing a panoramic (360 degrees) depth map is presented in this paper. Our approach uses a large collection of images taken by a camera whose motion has been constrained to planar concentric circles. We resample regular perspective images to produce a set of multiperspective panoramas and then compute depth maps directly from these resampled panoramas. Our panoramas sample uniformly in three dimensions: rotation angle, inverse radial distance, and vertical elevation. The use of multiperspective panoramas eliminates the limited overlap present in the original input images and, thus, problems as in conventional multibaseline stereo can be avoided. Our approach differs from stereo matching of single-perspective panoramic images taken from different locations, where the epipolar constraints are sine curves. For our multiperspective panoramas, the epipolar geometry, to the first order approximation, consists of horizontal lines. Therefore, any traditional stereo algorithm can be applied to multiperspective panoramas with little modification. In this paper, we describe two reconstruction algorithms. The first is a cylinder sweep algorithm that uses a small number of resampled multiperspective panoramas to obtain dense 3D reconstruction. The second algorithm, in contrast, uses a large number of multiperspective panoramas and takes advantage of the approximate horizontal epipolar geometry inherent in multiperspective panoramas. It comprises a novel and efficient 1D multibaseline matching technique, followed by tensor voting to extract the depth surface. Experiments show that our algorithms are capable of producing comparable high quality depth maps which can be used for applications such as view interpolation.},

In this work, we present a qualitative study examining the various methods that health vloggers use to establish a connection with their viewers. We found that vloggers used genres to express specific messages to their viewers while using the uniqueness of video to establish a deeper connection with their viewers. Health vloggers also explicitly sought interaction with their viewers. Based on these results, we present design implications to help facilitate and build sustainable communities for vloggers.},

Our study draws on the perspectives of the artists, visitors and a climate scientist to reveal how the work was designed and experienced. We show that the artists adopted a distinct approach that fostered an emotional engagement with data rather than an informative or persuasive one. We chart the performative strategies they used to achieve this including sensory engagement with data, a temporal structure that balanced liveness with slowness, and the juxtaposition of different treatments of the data to enable interpretation and dialogue.},

VD deteriorates visuomotor performance due to sensory conflict. Previous work has investigated this deterioration and human adaptation by comparing fixed VD and real eye conditions. In this study we go a step further to investigate whether any differences in visuomotor and adaptation trends exist across 16 distinct VD conditions. The performance tasks studied were of two types: foot placement and finger touch. In contrast to our initial prediction, the results showed equal task performance levels and adaptation within about 5 minutes regardless of VD conditions. We found that human adaptation covered a variety of VDs --- up to 55 mm in the X, Y direction; up to 125mm in the Z direction; and up to 140mm of interocular distance (IOD). In addition, we found that partial adaptation gave participants the interesting experience of a sense of body structure distortion for a few minutes.},

abstract = {Older adults are normally characterized as consumers, rather than producers, of digital content. Current research concerning the design of technologies for older adults typically focuses on providing access to digital resources. Access is important, but is often insufficient, especially when establishing new social relationships. This paper investigates the nature and role of digital content that has been created by older adults, for the purpose of forging new relationships. We present a unique field study in which seven older adults (aged 71-92 years), who did not know each other, used a prototype iPad application (Enmesh) to create and share photographs and messages. The findings demonstrate that older adults, even those in the $\backslash$'1c"oldest old$\backslash$'1d" age group, embraced opportunities to express themselves creatively through digital content production. We show that self-expression and social engagement with peers can be realized when socio-technical systems are suitably designed to allow older adults to create and share their own digital content.},

To create a contour model we synthesize different views of the object using its CAD model. During the view generation we alternate the camera pose as well as light conditions in order to extract the most stable contours in terms of illumination invariance and view independence. We project the extracted 2D edges back into the 3D space and accumulate for every 3D point statistics over different views describing its visibility and stability under different illumination conditions. After filtering out all 3D points with probability below a certain threshold value we use the Euclidean Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm to get the connected contours out of the 3D point cloud. The result is a B-Spline or VRML representation of the most stable contours.},

In particular, it is shown that the transition from an infinite speed of propagation for light waves to a finite one entails the replacement of a hyperplane at infinity with a light cone and the replacement of an affine hyperplane - or rest space - with a proper time hyperboloid. The transition from the metric theory of electromagnetism to the pre-metric theory is discussed in the context of complex projective geometry, and ultimately it is proposed that the geometrical issues are more general than electromagnetism, namely, they pertain to the transition from point mechanics to wave mechanics.},

In order to present an undistorted view to the virtual environment (VE), the perspective projection used to render the VE has to be adjusted to the limitations caused by the HMD characteristics. In particular, the geometric field of view (GFOV), which defines the virtual aperture angle used for rendering of the 3D scene, is set up according to the display field of view (DFOV). A discrepancy between these two fields of view distorts the geometry of the VE in a way that either minifies or magnifies the imagery displayed to the user. It has been shown that this distortion has the potential to affect a user's perception of the virtual space, sense of presence, and performance on visual search tasks. In this paper, we analyze the user's perception of a VE displayed in a HMD, which is rendered with different GFOVs. We introduce a psychophysical calibration method to determine the HMD's actual field of view, which may vary from the nominal values specified by the manufacturer. Furthermore, we conducted two experiments to identify perspective projections for HMDs, which are identified as natural by subjects--even if these perspectives deviate from the perspectives that are inherently defined by the DFOV. In the first experiment, subjects had to adjust the GFOV for a rendered virtual laboratory such that their perception of the virtual replica matched the perception of the real laboratory, which they saw before the virtual one. In the second experiment, we displayed the same virtual laboratory, but restricted the viewing condition in the real world to simulate the limited viewing condition in a HMD environment. We found that subjects evaluate a GFOV as natural when it is larger than the actual DFOV of the HMD--in some cases up to 50 percent--even when subjects viewed the real space with a limited field of view.},

Teaching students how to best use these methods is assisted by highly interactive, visual and motivational technology. Recent commodity pricing of depth ﬁeld cameras such as the Kinect makes an integrated approach to real time interactive teaching and learning of simulation and modelling feasible and exciting to students. We describe some of the techniques, software prototypes we have developed for teaching interactive simulation methods using devices such as the MS Kinect. We discuss examples including a discrete lattice model like the Ising model of a magnet, and continuous equation models such as ﬂuid ﬂow and speculate on the implications of ubiquitous depth-of-ﬁeld devices for highly interactive simulations for learning.},

abstract = {In Euclidean geometry, constructions are made with ruler and compass. Projective geometry is simpler: its constructions require only a ruler. In projective geometry one never measures anything, instead, one relates one set of points to another by a projectivity. The first two chapters of this book introduce the important concepts of the subject and provide the logical foundations. The third and fourth chapters introduce the famous theorems of Desargues and Pappus. Chapters 5 and 6 make use of projectivities on a line and plane, respectively. The next three chapters develop a self-contained account of von Staudt's approach to the theory of conics. The modern approach used in that development is exploited in Chapter 10, which deals with the simplest finite geometry that is rich enough to illustrate all the theorems nontrivially. The concluding chapters show the connections among projective, Euclidean, and analytic geometry.},

abstract = {Three efficient techniques are presented for modelling the shape of 3-D objects employing uncalibrated cameras, The first technique employing multiple video cameras is proposed for recovering the 3-D shape of non-rigid objects by factorization. The second technique employing pairs of facing cameras which surround a rigid object reconstructs an entire shape of the object by collecting all the projected feature points around the object into a single measurement matrix, which is factorized to yield an entire 3-D model of the object. The first and the second technique are combined to yield the third technique which not only models 3-D shape of a non-rigid object at each time but also recovers its deformation process during observation all at once. Satisfactory performance of these techniques are shown by the performed experiments. The present study is expected to contribute to various fields which have interests in 3-D shape/deformation recovery, modelling, and analysis, such as 3-D modelling of characters in video games, 3-D modelling of excavated objects in archaeology, human motion analysis in sports, dancing, or rehabilitation, etc},

Inexperienced goalkeepers divided into three groups moved a joystick in response to penalty kick situations presented on a large screen in pre-test, training and post-test phases of an experiment. The perceptual learning group practised with film clips that were edited to highlight relevant information in the run-up sequence of the kicker. The training group practised with the same film clips but without any highlights. A third group served as control and only performed the pre- and post-tests. The results showed that the visual search behaviour of the perceptual training group changed significantly and improved the initiation of the joystick movement. This initiation coincided with the timing of the most important visual information and led to significantly better performance than the other two groups (i.e. more penalties were stopped).},

abstract = {This paper proposes a depth measurement error model of consumer depth cameras such as Microsoft KINECT, and its calibration method. These devices are originally designed for video game interface, thus, the obtained depth map are not enough accurate for 3D measurement. To decrease these depth errors, several models have been proposed, however, these models consider only camera-related parameters. Since the depth sensors are based on projector-camera systems, we should consider projector-related parameters. Therefore, we propose the error model of the consumer depth cameras especially the KINECT, considering both intrinsic parameters of the camera and the projector. To calibrate the error model, we also propose the parameter estimation method by only showing a planar board to the depth sensors. Our error model and its calibration are necessary step for using the KINECT as a 3D measuring device. Experimental results show the validity and effectiveness of the error model and its calibration.},

abstract = {The first book on Modelica, a modeling language that can be used to simulate both continuous and discrete behavior, Introduction to Physical Modeling with Modelica provides the necessary background to develop Modelica models of almost any physical system. The author starts with basic differential equations from several engineering domains and describes how these equations can be used to create reusable component models. Next, he describes techniques for modeling complex non-linear behavior, exploiting the powerful array handling features and mixing continuous and discrete behavior. The second part of the book focuses on effective use of all the language features provided by the Modelica modeling language. This includes, among other things, discussions on maximizing the reusability of component models being developed, managing the model development process, and making models as computationally efficient as possible. Introduction to Physical Modeling with Modelica includes online access to supplementary material containing the Modelica source code for all examples as well as an evaluation copy of Dymola. Using Dymola, readers can immediately begin to explore the dynamics of the models included with the book or to develop their own models. Nearly 100 examples of mechanical, electrical, biological, chemical, thermal and hydraulic models are included. Introduction to Physical Modeling with Modelica will be of interest to all professional engineers and university researchers developing physical models. Students studying control system development or modeling of physical systems will also find it useful.},

O processo de desenvolvimento desse tipo de estudo de revis\~{a}o inclui caracterizar cada estudo selecionado, avaliar a qualidade deles, identificar conceitos importantes, comparar as an\'{a}lises estat\'{\i}sticas apresentadas e concluir sobre o que a literatura informa em rela\c{c}\~{a}o a determinada interven\c{c}\~{a}o, apontando ainda problemas/quest\~{o}es que necessitam de novos estudos. Um trabalho de revis\~{a}o sistem\'{a}tica segue a estrutura de um artigo original. Conclus\~{a}o: Boas revis\~{o}es sistem\'{a}ticas s\~{a}o recursos importantes ante o crescimento acelerado da informa\c{c}\~{a}o cient\'{\i}fica. Esses estudos ajudam a sintetizar a evid\^{e}ncia dispon\'{\i}vel na literatura sobre uma interven\c{c}\~{a}o, podendo auxiliar profissionais cl\'{\i}nicos e pesquisadores no seu cotidiano de trabalho.},

abstract = {Augmented Reality (AR) provides a natural interface to the "calm" pervasive technology anticipated in large-scale Ubiquitous Computing environments. However, the range of classic AR applications has been limited by the scope, range and cost of sensors used for tracking. Hybrid tracking approaches can go some way to extending this range. We propose an approach, called Ubiquitous Tracking, in which data from widespread and diverse heterogeneous tracking sensors is automatically and dynamically fused, and then transparently provided to applications. A formal model represents spatial relationships between objects as a graph attributed with quality-of-service parameters. This paper presents a software implementation, in which a dynamic data flow network of distributed software components is thereby constructed in response to queries and optimisation criteria specified by applications. This implementation is demonstrated using a small laboratory example, and larger setups modelled in a simulation environment.},

By initially considering electric technology broadly, our work informs how HCI approaches a range of specific interactive or digital things and materials.

A major result is to characterize electric technology by three forms of materiality: the electric object, its electric materiality, and electric power. In terms of design, we present and analyze novel interactive form prototypes. Our theoretical contributions offer new insight into design artifacts, just as our novel design artifacts help reveal new theoretical insight.},

abstract = {Prototyping of gestural interactions in the early phase of design is one of the most challenging tasks for designers without advanced programming skills. Relating users' input from gesture-based sensor values requires a great deal of effort on the designer's part and disturbs their reflective and creative thinking. To deal with this problem, we present EventHurdle, a visual gesture-authoring tool to support designers' explorative prototyping. It supports remote gestures from a camera, handheld gestures with physical sensors, and touch gestures by utilizing touch screens. EventHurdle allows designers to visually define and modify gestures through interaction workspace and graphical markup language with hurdles. Because the created gestures can be integrated into a prototype as programming code and automatically recognized, designers do not need to pay attention in sensor-related implementation. Two user studies and a recognition test are reported to discuss the acceptance and implications of explorative prototyping tools for designers.},

abstract = {Today, the human eye-gaze can be recorded by relatively unobtrusive techniques. This thesis argues that it is possible to use the eye-gaze of a computer user in the interface to aid the control of the application. Care must be taken, though, that eye-gaze tracking data is used in a sensible way, since the nature of human eye-movements is a combination of several voluntary and involuntary cognitive processes. The main reason for eye-gaze based user interfaces being attractive is that the direction of the eye-gaze can express the interests of the user -- it is a potential porthole into the current cognitive processes -- and communication through the direction of the eyes is faster than any other mode of human communication. It is argued that eye-gaze tracking data is best used in multimodal interfaces where the user interacts with the data instead of the interface, in so-called noncommand user interfaces. Furthermore, five usability criteria for eye-gaze media are given. This thesis also sugges...},

abstract = {Tracking is a major issue of virtual and augmented real- ity applications. Single object tracking on monocular video streams is fairly well understood. However, when it comes to multiple objects, existing methods lack scalability and can recognize only a limited number of objects. Thanks to recent progress in feature matching, state-of-the-art image retrieval techniques can deal with millions of images. However, these methods do not focus on real-time video processing and can not track retrieved objects. In this paper,we present a method that combines the speed and accuracy of tracking with the scalability of image re- trieval. At the heart of our approach is a bi-layer clustering process that allows our system to index and retrieve objects based on tracks of features, thereby effectively summarizing the information available on multiple video frames. As a result, our system is able to track in real-time multiple objects, recognized with low delay from a database of more than 300 entries.},

Before the reconstruction step and after the step of matching, a search is conducted among the set of triplets of matched 2-D faces (supposed to be the projection of 3-D faces) for the triplets which really correspond to planar 3-D surfaces. To accurately reconstruct the surface, a check is conducted in 2-D space for the classes of triplets of faces which correspond to 3-D coplanar structures. It is shown how these 3-D properties are checked in the 2-D space, using tools of projective geometry, allowing the constraint of the 3-D reconstruction in order to maintain these 3-D properties},

@article{Savelsbergh2002,
abstract = {We used a novel methodological approach to examine skill-based differences in anticipation and visual search behaviour during the penalty kick in soccer. Expert and novice goalkeepers were required to move a joystick in response to penalty kicks presented on film. The proportion of penalties saved was assessed, as well as the frequency and time of initiation of joystick corrections. Visual search behaviour was examined using an eye movement registration system. Expert goalkeepers were generally more accurate in predicting the direction of the penalty kick, waited longer before initiating a response and made fewer corrective movements with the joystick. The expert goalkeepers used a more efficient search strategy involving fewer fixations of longer duration to less disparate areas of the display. The novices spent longer fixating on the trunk, arms and hips, whereas the experts found the kicking leg, non-kicking leg and ball areas to be more informative, particularly as the moment of foot-ball contact approached. No differences in visual search behaviour were observed between successful and unsuccessful penalties. The results have implications for improving anticipation skill at penalty kicks.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a method that can calibrates color camera and depth camera of Kinect simultaneously, and finally get the relative pose between them. The calibration process for color camera and depth camera is designed by taking advantage of two different method respectively. As we know, the depth information can be acquired readily from the depth image, however, under the consideration of the fuzzy boundary and the overlapping of object in depth image, we choose using one-dimensional object for calibrating depth camera and propose a nonlinear method to optimize its intrinsic parameter. As for color camera calibration, we design a cross shape object for calibration and validation. Both methods are strongly robust to noise and much easier to implement. The experiment result shows a better accuracy in comparison with the proprietary calibration procedure of the manufacturer.},

abstract = {A number of studies in the literature have looked into the use of real-time biometric data to improve one's own physiological performance and wellbeing. However, there is limited research that looks into the effects that sharing biometric data with others could have on one's social network. Following a period of research on existing mobile applications and prototype testing, we developed a system, HeartLink, which collects real-time personal biometric data such as heart rate and broadcasts this data online. Insights gained on designing systems to broadcast real-time biometric data are presented. In this paper we also report emerging results from testing HeartLink in a pilot study and a user study that were conducted during sport events. The results showed that sharing heart rate data does influence the relationship of the persons involved and that the degree of influence seems related to the tie strength prior to visualizing the data.},

The findings are organised under four emergent themes: Workplace Ecology, Data Entry Skills and Knowledge, Achieving Targets and Collaborative Working. For each theme a description of how the work is undertaken in the outsourcer's Indian office locations is given, followed by the implications for crowdsourcing that work. This research is a first step in understanding how crowdsourcing might be applied to BPO activities. The paper examines features specific to form digitization - extreme distribution and form decomposition - and lightly touches on the crowdsourcing of BPO work more generally.},

abstract = {This paper gives an end-to-end overview of 3D video and free viewpoint video, which can be regarded as advanced functionalities that expand the capabilities of a 2D video. Free viewpoint video can be understood as the functionality to freely navigate within real world visual scenes, as it is known for instance from virtual worlds in computer graphics. 3D video shall be understood as the functionality that provides the user with a 3D depth impression of the observed scene, which is also known as stereo video. In that sense as functionalities, 3D video and free viewpoint video are not mutually exclusive but can very well be combined in a single system. Research in this area combines computer graphics, computer vision and visual communications. It spans the whole media processing chain from capture to display and the design of systems has to take all parts into account, which is outlined in different sections of this paper giving an end-to-end view and mapping of this broad area. The conclusion is that the necessary technology including standard media formats for 3D video and free viewpoint video is available or will be available in the future, and that there is a clear demand from industry and user for such advanced types of visual media.

A prestudy combined the temporal and spatial occlusion paradigms to ascertain which key stimuli badminton players use for anticipating the direction of overhead shots. The main study then evaluated a program for training anticipatory skills; 200 video clips were employed to orient attention toward these key stimuli. Participants were 63 badminton novices, 20 national league players, and 21 local league players. A transparent red patch (exogenous orienting) was used to orient attention toward the trunk up to 160 ms before racket-shuttle contact; the arm, from 160 ms to 80 ms before contact; and the racket, from 80 ms before to actual contact. Results showed that badminton novices who trained with this program signifi cantly improved their anticipatory skill between post- and retention test compared with controls. Whereas local league players improved from pre- to posttest, training had no effect on expert national league players. It is concluded that using red transparent patches to highlight the most informative cues in perceptual training programs is a promising way to improve anticipatory skill.},

abstract = {Animation techniques are used during simulation studies for verifying and validating the model, and for communication purposes to external parties. Including animation in a simulation model, often results in models that contain many references to animation specific code. Moreover, in the specific case of discrete event simulation, challenges arise due to the difference in time-bases with animation techniques that mostly have a discrete notion of time. Typical approaches to developing animation for simulation models provide tightly coupled simulation and animation components that are fine-tuned to provide acceptable results. Apart of the disadvantage of having entangled model and animation code, this also has the disadvantage of reduced flexibility that one would desire in order to be able to use other animation techniques: for instance going from 2D to 3D with modern visualization libraries. In this paper, we will present our approach for loosely coupled discrete event simulation models and animation components.},

abstract = {Free viewpoint video presentation is a new challenge in multimedia analysis. This paper presents an innovative physics-based scheme to reconstruct the 3D ball trajectory from single-camera volleyball video sequences for free viewpoint virtual replay. The problem of 2D-to-3D inference is arduous due to the loss of 3D information in projection to 2D images. The proposed scheme incorporates the domain knowledge of court specification and the physical characteristics of ball motion to accomplish the 2D-to-3D inference. Motion equations with the parameters are set up to define the 3D trajectories based on physical characteristics. Utilizing the geometric transformation of camera calibration, the 2D ball coordinates extracted over frames are used to approximate the parameters of the 3D motion equations, and finally the 3D ball trajectory can be reconstructed from single-camera sequences. The experiments show promising results. The reconstructed 3D trajectory enables the free viewpoint virtual replay and enriched visual presentation, making game watching a whole new experience.},

For this, we take advantage of very fast and implicit, yet imprecise gaze- and head-directed input in combination with ubiquitous smartphones for additional manual touch control. We have carefully elaborated two novel and consistent sets of gaze-supported interaction techniques based on touch-enhanced gaze pointers and local magnification lenses. These conflict-free sets allow for fluently selecting and positioning distant targets. Both sets were evaluated in a user study with 16 participants. Overall, users were fastest with a touch-enhanced gaze pointer for selecting and positioning an object after some training. While the positive user feedback for both sets suggests that our proposed gaze- and head-directed interaction techniques are suitable for a convenient and fluent selection and manipulation of distant targets, further improvements are necessary for more precise cursor control.},

Fulfilling this obligation is especially difficult in classroom settings, which often lack authentic interaction with the outside world. Online crowdsourcing has the potential to change this. Our research explores if and how online crowds can support student learning in the classroom. We explore how scalable, diverse, immediate (and often ambiguous and conflicting) input from online crowds affects student learning and motivation for project-based innovation work. In a pilot study with three classrooms, we explore interactions with the crowd at four key stages of the innovation process: needfinding, ideating, testing, and pitching. Students reported that online crowds helped them quickly and inexpensively identify needs and uncover issues with early-stage prototypes, although they favored face-to-face interactions for more contextual feed-back. We share early evidence and discuss implications for creating a socio-technical infrastructure to more effectively use crowdsourcing in education.},

abstract = {Online labor markets, such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk), provide an attractive platform for conducting human subjects experiments because the relative ease of recruitment, low cost, and a diverse pool of potential participants enable larger-scale experimentation and faster experimental revision cycle compared to lab-based settings. However, because the experimenter gives up the direct control over the participants' environments and behavior, concerns about the quality of the data collected in online settings are pervasive. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of conducting online performance evaluations of user interfaces with anonymous, unsupervised, paid participants recruited via MTurk. We implemented three performance experiments to re-evaluate three previously well-studied user interface designs. We conducted each experiment both in lab and online with participants recruited via MTurk. The analysis of our results did not yield any evidence of significant or substantial differences in the data collected in the two settings: All statistically significant differences detected in lab were also present on MTurk and the effect sizes were similar. In addition, there were no significant differences between the two settings in the raw task completion times, error rates, consistency, or the rates of utilization of the novel interaction mechanisms introduced in the experiments. These results suggest that MTurk may be a productive setting for conducting performance evaluations of user interfaces providing a complementary approach to existing methodologies.},

abstract = {A large fraction of scientific and engineering computations involve sparse matrices. While dense matrix computations can be parallelized relatively easily, sparse matrices with arbitrary or irregular structure pose a real challenge to designers of highly parallel machines. A recent paper by N.K. Karmarkar (1991) proposed a new parallel architecture for sparse matrix computations based on finite projective geometries. Mathematical structure of these geometries plays an important role in defining the interconnections between the processors and memories in this architecture, and also aids in efficiently solving several difficult problems (such as load balancing, data-routing, memory-access conflicts, etc.) that are encountered in the design of parallel systems. The authors discuss some of the key issues in the system design of such a machine, and show how exploiting the structure of the geometry results in an efficient hardware implementation of the machine. They also present circuit designs and simulation results for key elements of the system: a 200 MHz pipelined memory; a pipelined multiplier based on an adder unit with a delay of 2 ns; and a 500 Mbit/s CMOS input/output buffer},

Over the last decade, many approaches have been introduced to achieve head pose estimation in both academical and industrial fields, but the low-cost and real-time application still proves to be a difficult task. Motivated by the past researches, we propose an automatic and monocular head pose estimation system. We applied a number of improvements to a direct linear transformation algorithm called Pose from Orthography and Scaling with ITerations (POSIT) and applied it for the head pose estimation. User's virtual head model is also recovered by analyzing laser scan database and corrected by the head pose. The entire process is completely automatic with no need for users to pre-register for identification or initialize their head position. Experiments on a public dataset show realtime performance with lower errors than previous head pose estimation methods.},

abstract = {As a core robotic and vision problem, camera and range sensor calibration have been researched intensely over the last decades. However, robotic research efforts still often get heavily delayed by the requirement of setting up a calibrated system consisting of multiple cameras and range measurement units. With regard to removing this burden, we present a toolbox with web interface for fully automatic camera-to-camera and camera-to-range calibration. Our system is easy to setup and recovers intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters as well as the transformation between cameras and range sensors within one minute. In contrast to existing calibration approaches, which often require user intervention, the proposed method is robust to varying imaging conditions, fully automatic, and easy to use since a single image and range scan proves sufficient for most calibration scenarios. Experimentally, we demonstrate that the proposed checkerboard corner detector significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art. Furthermore, the proposed camera-to-range registration method is able to discover multiple solutions in the case of ambiguities. Experiments using a variety of sensors such as grayscale and color cameras, the Kinect 3D sensor and the Velodyne HDL-64 laser scanner show the robustness of our method in different indoor and outdoor settings and under various lighting conditions.},

abstract = {This paper presents a fully automated algorithm for reconstructing a textured 3D model of a face from a single photograph or a raw video stream. The algorithm is based on a combination of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and a Morphable Model of 3D faces. After SVM face detection, individual facial features are detected using a novel regression- and classification-based approach, and probabilistically plausible configurations of features are selected to produce a list of candidates for several facial feature positions. In the next step, the configurations of feature points are evaluated using a novel criterion that is based on a Morphable Model and a combination of linear projections. To make the algorithm robust with respect to head orientation, this process is iterated while the estimate of pose is refined. Finally, the feature points initialize a model-fitting procedure of the Morphable Model. The result is a high resolution 3D surface model.},

abstract = {Computer-aided surgery (CAS), the intraoperative application of biomedical visualization techniques, appears to be one of the most promising fields of application for augmented reality (AR), the display of additional computer-generated graphics over a real-world scene. Typically a device such as a head-mounted display (HMD) is used for AR. However, considerable technical problems connected with AR have limited the intraoperative application of HMDs up to now. One of the difficulties in using HMDs is the requirement for a common optical focal plane for both the realworld scene and the computer-generated image, and acceptance of the HMD by the user in a surgical environment. In order to increase the clinical acceptance of AR, we have adapted the Varioscope (Life Optics, Vienna), a miniature, cost-effective head-mounted operating binocular, for AR. In this paper, we present the basic design of the modified HMD, and the method and results of an extensive laboratory study for photogrammetric calibration of the Varioscope's computer displays to a real-world scene. In a series of 16 calibrations with varying zoom factors and object distances, mean calibration error was found to be 1.24 +/- 0.38 pixels or 0.12 +/- 0.05 mm for a 640 x 480 display. Maximum error accounted for 3.33 +/- 1.04 pixels or 0.33 +/- 0.12 mm. The location of a position measurement probe of an optical tracking system was transformed to the display with an error of less than 1 mm in the real world in 56\% of all cases. For the remaining cases, error was below 2 mm. We conclude that the accuracy achieved in our experiments is sufficient for a wide range of CAS applications.},

The algorithm uses the explicit definition of a plane which allows storing only four parameters per plane rather than storing thousands of points. Extraction of multiple planes from the same set of points is prevented using a rejection mechanism. Parallelism is used for an average speed-up of 2.3:1.

Limits of depth estimate resolution and line of sight requirements dictate that the determination of the moment of touch will not be as precise as that of more direct sensing techniques such as capacitive touch screens. However, using a depth-sensing camera to detect touch has significant advantages: first, the interactive surface need not be instrumented. Secondly, this approach allows touch sensing on non-flat surfaces. Finally, information about the shape of the users and their arms and hands above the surface may be exploited in useful ways, such as determining hover state, or that multiple touches are from same hand or from the same user. We present techniques and findings using Microsoft Kinect.},

abstract = {In cricket, a batsman watches a fast bowler's ball come toward him at a high and unpredictable speed, bouncing off ground of uncertain hardness. Although he views the trajectory for little more than half a second, he can accurately judge where and when the ball will reach him. Batsmen's eye movements monitor the moment when the ball is released, make a predictive saccade to the place where they expect it to hit the ground, wait for it to bounce, and follow its trajectory for 100-200 ms after the bounce. We show how information provided by these fixations may allow precise prediction of the ball's timing and placement. Comparing players with different skill levels, we found that a short latency for the first saccade distinguished good from poor batsmen, and that a cricket player's eye movement strategy contributes to his skill in the game.},

In this paper, a method based on projective geometry is introduced to correct the projective distortion of infrared images. The dual conic in distortion image, which contains all the information of projective rectification, is identified firstly, and then the projective transformation matrix is derived by decomposing the dual conic. Finally, optimization is carried out to get the optimal result. Experimental results show that the method used in this paper can remove the projective distortion of infrared image effectively.},

We present a system to automatically create high quality stereoscopic video from monoscopic footage of field-based sports by exploiting context-specific priors, such as the ground plane, player size and known background. Our main contribution is a novel technique that constructs per-shot panoramas to ensure temporally consistent stereoscopic depth in video reconstructions. Players are rendered as billboards at correct depths on the ground plane. Our method uses additional sports priors to disambiguate segmentation artifacts and produce synthesized 3D shots that are in most cases, indistinguishable from stereoscopic ground truth footage.},

abstract = {Pupil center localization is fundamental to calculate eye orientation and gaze direction in video-based systems. In previous techniques, either it is assumed that the pupil center is same as iris center or active illumination is utilized. In this paper, we have developed a new technique which utilizes eye geometry to localize pupil center without requiring special lighting. The main idea in the proposed technique is to restrict search space of the pupil center to the minor diameter of the iris ellipse proved from the geometrical model of eye proposed in this paper. In the proposed technique, we fit an ellipse to iris boundary, which is very simpler than ellipse fitting for pupil boundary in images on the common illumination, and then estimate pupil center by searching minor diameter of the iris ellipse. The performance of the method has been evaluated on both synthetic and real images.},

abstract = {Tracking is a very important research subject in a real-time augmented reality context. The main requirements for trackers are high accuracy and little latency at a reasonable cost. In order to address these issues, a real-time, robust, and efficient 3D model-based tracking algorithm is proposed for a "video see through" monocular vision system. The tracking of objects in the scene amounts to calculating the pose between the camera and the objects. Virtual objects can then be projected into the scene using the pose. Here, nonlinear pose estimation is formulated by means of a virtual visual servoing approach. In this context, the derivation of point-to-curves interaction matrices are given for different 3D geometrical primitives including straight lines, circles, cylinders, and spheres. A local moving edges tracker is used in order to provide real-time tracking of points normal to the object contours. Robustness is obtained by integrating an M-estimator into the visual control law via an iteratively reweighted least squares implementation. This approach is then extended to address the 3D model-free augmented reality problem. The method presented in this paper has been validated on several complex image sequences including outdoor environments. Results show the method to be robust to occlusion, changes in illumination, and mistracking.},

@article{Chang2007,
abstract = {In recent years, the success of single-robot SLAM has led to more multi-robot SLAM (MR-SLAM) research. A team of robots with MR-SLAM can explore an environment more efficiently and reliably; however, MR-SLAM also raises many challenging problems, including map fusion, unknown robot poses and scalability issues. The first two problems can be considered as an optimization problem of finding a consistent joint map based on robots\&x2019; relative poses and sensory data. This optimization problem exhibits a similar property of a singlerobot topological/metric mapping. To exploit this property, we propose a multi-robot SLAM (MR-SLAM) algorithm, which builds a graph-like topological map with vertices representing local metric maps and edges describing relative positions of adjacent local maps. In this MR-SLAM algorithm, the map fusion between two robots can be naturally done by adding an edge that connects two topological maps, and the estimation of relative robot pose is simply performed by optimizing this edge. For the third scalable problem, the proposed algorithm is also scalable to the number of robots and the size of an environment. Computer simulations with a public data set and experimental work on Pioneer 3-DX robots have been conducted to validate the performance of the proposed MR-SLAM algorithm.},

The technology is used to create a common ground between the organisations and allows the users to interact, plan resources and react to the ongoing events on a digital map. The AR application was developed and evaluated in a study where a forest fire scenario was simulated. Participants from the involved organisations acted as command and control teams in the simulated scenario and both quantitative and qualitative results were obtained. The results show that AR can become a useful tool in these situations in the future.},

abstract = {The formal literature review within the broader genre of academic writing remains problematic, and despite vigorous interest in other aspects of the genre, largely avoided by ESP researchers. Because such reviews are considered highly personal and interpretative, our reluctance to intervene is not surprising. However, the difficulties students are faced with are at least partially linguistic, and therefore the language teacher would seem to have something to offer. Recent developments in schema theory seem to offer a way out of the impasse, and the chance to develop language teaching technologies appropriate to language enhancement programs offered to graduate students in various fields, most particularly engineering. This paper presents results from classroom-initiated research into the use of text-graphing with engineering masters degree students working on their thesis proposals.},

abstract = {The paper reflects on three approaches to the dissemination and display of digital art. “s[edition]” is a novel, web-based service that offers limited editions of “digital prints”. Analysis of user comments suggests that the metaphor of a “limited digital edition” raises issues and to some extent is resisted. The second approach is the Flickr Brushes Gallery, where digital painters post images and comment on one another’s work. Analysis of comment boards indicates that the shared art and comments are a form of gift exchange. Finally, the paper discusses a field study in which artists exhibited their work as it develops over time in digital frames and also in an immersive digital projection room. Analysis of field notes and interviews indicate that the digital frame approach was unsuccessful because of aesthetic and environmental concerns. The immersive projection suggested that more experiential approaches may be more interesting. It is argued that there is an inherent resistance in digital media to previous models of art commoditization. None of the approaches discussed here resolve the dilemma but rather indicate the scope and complexity of the issues.},

Both approaches addresses the following challenges of collision detection algorithms: just in time, little resources, inclusive etc. Thus both approaches are scalable in the information they give in collision determination and the analysis up to a fixed refinement level, the collision time depends on the granularity of the bounding volumes and it is also possible to estimate the time bounds for the collision test tightly},

However, the accessibility difficulties pervasive in UGC warrant discussion and analysis distinct from other kinds of online content. Content authors, community culture, and the authoring tool itself all affect UGC accessibility. The choices, resources available, and strategies in use to ensure accessibility are different than for other types of online content. We contribute case studies of two UGC communities with accessible content: Wikipedia, where authors focus on access to visual materials and navigation, and an online health support forum where users moderate the cognitive accessibility of posts. Our data demonstrate real world moderation strategies and illuminate factors affecting success, such as community culture. We conclude with recommended strategies for creating a culture of accessibility around UGC.},

A whole generation of secondary journals, pre-appraised evidence libraries and periodically updated elec- tronic texts are now available to clinicians. However, not all systematic reviews are of high quality, and it is important to be able to critically assess their validity and applicability. This article is an illustrated guide for conducting systematic reviews. A clear understanding of the process will provide clinicians with the tools to judiciously appraise reviews and interpret them.

abstract = {Flexpad is an interactive system that combines a depth camera and a projector to transform sheets of plain paper or foam into flexible, highly deformable, and spatially aware handheld displays. We present a novel approach for tracking deformed surfaces from depth images in real time. It captures deformations in high detail, is very robust to occlusions created by the user's hands and fingers, and does not require any kind of markers or visible texture. As a result, the display is considerably more deformable than in previous work on flexible handheld displays, enabling novel applications that leverage the high expressiveness of detailed deformation. We illustrate these unique capabilities through three application examples: curved cross-cuts in volumetric images, deforming virtual paper characters, and slicing through time in videos. Results from two user studies show that our system is capable of detecting complex deformations and that users are able to perform them quickly and precisely.},

However, there is little empirical evidence about the advantages or disadvantages of this approach. We developed a new interaction technique for eye movement interaction in a virtual environment and compared it to more conventional 3-D pointing. We conducted an experiment to compare performance of the two interaction types and to assess their impacts on spatial memory of subjects and to explore subjects' satisfaction with the two types of interactions. We found that the eye movement-based interaction was faster than pointing, especially for distant objects. However, subjects' ability to recall spatial information was weaker in the eye condition than the pointing one. Subjects reported equal satisfaction with both types of interactions, despite the technology limitations of current eye tracking equipment.},

The second has been the recognition of the role of internal reward in guiding eye and body movements, revealed especially in neurophysiological studies. The third important advance has been the theoretical developments in the fields of reinforcement learning and graphic simulation.

Current systems use devices such as the Polaris Vicra position sensor to monitor the position and orientation of a tracking tool which is fixed to the subject. Although in principle these methods offer high positional accuracy this is lost if the tool slips. Markerless motion tracking aims to track the object directly without the use of markers or a tracking tool. To date these methods have either been unsuccessful or too expensive to have been widely implemented. The Microsoft Kinect is a low cost RGB+D (colour plus depth) video camera. We have used the Kinect to perform motion tracking of a head phantom using a CT of the head as a high resolution template. We present initial results that show the Kinect can track rigid body motion to within <;2 mm of that measured by a Polaris system. We use the PointCloudLibrary open project [1] algorithm implementations to register the CT template to the Kinect frames.},

Theoretically, it describes three principles of system design which we believe must be followed to produce a useful and easy to use computer system. These principles are: early and continual focus on users; empirical measurement of usage; and iterative design whereby the system (simulated, prototype, and real) is modified, tested, modified again, tested again, and the cycle is repeated again and again. This approach is contrasted to other principled design approaches, for example, get it right the first time, reliance on design guidelines. Empirically, the article presents data which show that our design principles are not always intuitive to designers; identifies the arguments which designers often offer for not using these principles—and answers them; and provides an example in which our principles have been used successfully.},

abstract = {With proper calibration of its color and depth cameras, the Kinect can capture detailed color point clouds at up to 30 frames per second. This capability positions the Kinect for use in robotics as a low-cost navigation sensor. Thus, techniques for efficiently calibrating the Kinect depth camera and altering its optical system to improve suitability for imaging short-range obstacles are presented. To perform depth calibration, a calibration rig and software were developed to automatically map raw depth values to object depths. The calibration rig consisted of a traditional chessboard calibration target with easily locatable features in depth at its exterior corners that facilitated software extraction of corresponding object depths and raw depth values. To modify the Kinect's optics for improved short-range imaging, Nyko's Zoom adapter was used due to its simplicity and low cost. Although effective at reducing the Kinect's minimum range, these optics introduced pronounced distortion in depth. A method based on capturing depth images of planar objects at various depths produced an empirical depth distortion model for correcting such distortion in software. Together, the modified optics and the empirical depth undistortion procedure demonstrated the ability to improve the Kinect's resolution and decrease its minimum range by approximately 30\%.},

abstract = {We present a complete system for live capture of 3D content and simultaneous presentation in augmented reality. The user sees the real world from his viewpoint, but modified so that the image of a remote collaborator is rendered into the scene. Fifteen cameras surround the collaborator, and the resulting video streams are used to construct a three-dimensional model of the subject using a shape-from-silhouette algorithm. Users view a two-dimensional fiducial marker using a video-see-through augmented reality interface. The geometric relationship between the marker and head-mounted camera is calculated, and the equivalent view of the subject is computed and drawn into the scene. Our system can generate 384 288 pixel images of the models at 25 fps, with a latency of < 100 ms. The result gives the strong impression that the subject is a real part of the 3D scene. We demonstrate applications of this system in 3D videoconferencing and entertainment.},

abstract = {Free-viewpoint video is a promising technology for next-generation virtual and augmented reality applications. Our goal is to enhance collaborative VR applications with 3D video-conferencing features. In this paper, we propose a 3D video streaming technique which can be deployed in telepresence environments. The streaming characteristics of real-time 3D video sequences are investigated under various system and networking conditions. We introduce several encoding techniques and analyze their behavior with respect to resolution, bandwidth and inter-frame jitter. Our 3D video pipeline uses point samples as basic primitives and is fully integrated with a communication framework handling acknowledgment information for reliable network transmissions and application control data. The 3D video reconstruction process dynamically adapts to processing and networking bottlenecks. Our results show that a reliable transmission of our pixel-based differential prediction encoding leads to the best performance in terms of bandwidth, but is also quite sensitive to packet losses. A redundantly encoded stream achieves better results in presence of burst losses and seamlessly adapts to varying network throughput.},

abstract = {A solution that allows each individual to look unique in a real-time large crowd simulation. First, it provides a simple, efficient method for attaching accessories to individuals to modify their look. Second, it provides a new, generic technique based on segmentation maps for adding detailed color variety and patterns to human meshes as well as accessories. Both methods are scalable to suit all human levels of detail exploited in crowd simulations; that is, impostors and rigid and deformable meshes. Tests and comparisons show that the algorithm provides the crowd with an appealing visual aspect and is adequate for real-time simulations of thousands of unique characters.},

@article{Fauser2002,
abstract = {Quantum Clifford Algebras (QCA), i.e. Clifford Hopf gebras based on bilinear forms of arbitrary symmetry, are treated in a broad sense. Five alternative constructions of QCAs are exhibited. Grade free Hopf gebraic product formulas are derived for meet and join of Grassmann-Cayley algebras including co-meet and co-join for Grassmann-Cayley co-gebras which are very efficient and may be used in Robotics, left and right contractions, left and right co-contractions, Clifford and co-Clifford products, etc. The Chevalley deformation, using a Clifford map, arises as a special case. We discuss Hopf algebra versus Hopf gebra, the latter emerging naturally from a bi-convolution. Antipode and crossing are consequences of the product and co-product structure tensors and not subjectable to a choice. A frequently used Kuperberg lemma is revisited necessitating the definition of non-local products and interacting Hopf gebras which are generically non-perturbative. A `spinorial' generalization of the antipode is given. The non-existence of non-trivial integrals in low-dimensional Clifford co-gebras is shown. Generalized cliffordization is discussed which is based on non-exponentially generated bilinear forms in general resulting in non unital, non-associative products. Reasonable assumptions lead to bilinear forms based on 2-cocycles. Cliffordization is used to derive time- and normal-ordered generating functionals for the Schwinger-Dyson hierarchies of non-linear spinor field theory and spinor electrodynamics. The relation between the vacuum structure, the operator ordering, and the Hopf gebraic counit is discussed. QCAs are proposed as the natural language for (fermionic) quantum field theory.},

The technique uses front-to-back compositing of implicitly defined grass slices in a fragment shader and therefore significantly reduces the overhead associated with common vegetation rendering systems. We also introduce a texture-based animation scheme that combines global wind movements with local turbulences. Since the technique is confined to a fragment shader, it can be easily integrated into any rendering system and used as a material in existing scenes.},

abstract = {Design visualization is key to the communication and shared perception of designs and is essential for meaningful design development and collaborations. The initial development of an Augmented Reality Computer Aided Drawing (AR CAD) system for enhancing visualization of models created in standard CAD was presented at the 17th ISARC. AR CAD features a more natural mode for changing views of the model and completely understanding the model content. Expected benefits are improved efficiency in the design detailing function, both for the individual detailer and for design collaborations where maintaining an accurate shared understanding of the design model is critical. An experimental program is under way to examine the impact of AR CAD upon a users perception and recall of a design model. Related experiments with desktop and immersive virtual environments have found that motion cues can indeed markedly improve spatial cognition. It is expected that we will see the same benefits in our AR CAD system, although until now such studies have not been conducted in an AR environment. This paper presents the rationale for experiments to measure the impact of AR CAD in terms of cognition cost, and it lays the foundation for further application of Mixed Reality (MR) technology to the design, construction, and maintenance phases of a facilitys life cycle. MR applications may prove promising for effective communication of designs for prefabrication, site installation, and the planning and excecution of maintenance operations.},

In order to support various teacher-student interaction scenarios we implemented flexible methods for context and user dependent rendering of parts of the construction. Together with hybrid hardware setups they allow the use of Construct3D in today's classrooms and provide a testbed for future evaluations. Means of application and integration in mathematics and geometry education at high school as well as university level are being discussed. Anecdotal evidence supports our claim that Construct3D is easy to learn, encourages experimentation with geometric constructions and improves spatial skills.},

abstract = {A proof of concept for a model-less target detection and classification system for side-scan imagery is presented. The system is based on a supervised approach that uses augmented reality (AR) images for training computer added detection and classification (CAD/CAC) algorithms, which are then deployed on real data. The algorithms are able to generalise and detect real targets when trained on AR ones, with performances comparable with the state-of-the-art in CAD/CAC. To illustrate the approach, the focus is on one specific algorithm, which uses Bayesian decision and the novel, purpose-designed central filter feature extractors. Depending on how the training database is partitioned, the algorithm can be used either for detection or classification. Performance figures for these two modes of operation are presented, both for synthetic and real targets. Typical results show a detection rate of more that 95\% and a false alarm rate of less than 5\%. The proposed supervised approach can be directly applied to train and evaluate other learning algorithms and data representations. In fact, a most important aspect is that it enables the use of a wealth of legacy pattern recognition algorithms for the sonar CAD/CAC applications of target detection and target classification},

abstract = {This paper presents an interactive theatre based on an embodied mixed reality space and wearable computers. Embodied computing mixed reality spaces integrate ubiquitous computing, tangible interaction and social computing within a mixed reality space, which enables intuitive interaction with physical world and virtual world. We believe it has potential advantages to support novel interactive theatre experiences. Therefore, we explored the novel interactive theatre experience supported in the embodied mixed reality space, and implemented live 3D characters to interact with user in such a system.},

abstract = {Cluster-based tiled display walls can provide cost-effective and scalable displays with high resolution and a large display area. The software to drive them needs to scale too if arbitrarily large displays are to be built. Chromium is a popular software API used to construct such displays. Chromium transparently renders any OpenGL application to a tiled display by partitioning and sending individual OpenGL primitives to each client per frame. Visualization applications often deal with massive geometric data with millions of primitives. Transmitting them every frame results in huge network requirements that adversely affect the scalability of the system. In this paper, we present Garuda, a client-server-based display wall framework that uses off-the-shelf hardware and a standard network. Garuda is scalable to large tile configurations and massive environments. It can transparently render any application built using the Open Scene Graph (OSG) API to a tiled display without any modification by the user. The Garuda server uses an object-based scene structure represented using a scene graph. The server determines the objects visible to each display tile using a novel adaptive algorithm that culls the scene graph to a hierarchy of frustums. Required parts of the scene graph are transmitted to the clients, which cache them to exploit the interframe redundancy. A multicast-based protocol is used to transmit the geometry to exploit the spatial redundancy present in tiled display systems. A geometry push philosophy from the server helps keep the clients in sync with one another. Neither the server nor a client needs to render the entire scene, making the system suitable for interactive rendering of massive models. Transparent rendering is achieved by intercepting the cull, draw, and swap functions of OSG and replacing them with our own. We demonstrate the performance and scalability of the Garuda system for different configurations of display wall. We also show that the server and network loads grow sublinearly with the increase in the number of tiles, which makes our scheme suitable to construct very large displays.},

abstract = {Tracking is a very important research subject in a real-time augmented reality context. The main requirements for trackers are high accuracy and little latency at a reasonable cost. In order to address these issues, a real-time, robust, and efficient 3D model-based tracking algorithm is proposed for a "video see through" monocular vision system. The tracking of objects in the scene amounts to calculating the pose between the camera and the objects. Virtual objects can then be projected into the scene using the pose. Here, nonlinear pose estimation is formulated by means of a virtual visual servoing approach. In this context, the derivation of point-to-curves interaction matrices are given for different 3D geometrical primitives including straight lines, circles, cylinders, and spheres. A local moving edges tracker is used in order to provide real-time tracking of points normal to the object contours. Robustness is obtained by integrating an M-estimator into the visual control law via an iteratively reweighted least squares implementation. This approach is then extended to address the 3D model-free augmented reality problem. The method presented in this paper has been validated on several complex image sequences including outdoor environments. Results show the method to be robust to occlusion, changes in illumination, and mistracking.},

The user's view is augmented with location based information at the correct spatial location, thus providing an intuitive way of presenting such information. In this work we demonstrate the use of AR for collaborative navigation and information browsing tasks in an urban environment. A navigation function allows one or more users to roam through a city and guides them to selected destinations. Information browsing presents users with information about objects in their surrounding. Both functions feature support for collaboration. The developed system does not only concentrate on the user interface aspects but also provides a scalable infrastructure to support mobile applications. To this end we developed a 3-tier architecture to manage a common data model for a set of applications. It is inspired by current Internet application frameworks and consists of a central storage layer using a common data model, a transformation layer responsible for filtering and adapting the data to the requirements of a particular applications on request, and finally of the applications itself.},

Mobile augmented reality requires highly accurate and fast six degrees of freedom tracking in order to provide registered graphical overlays to a mobile user. With advances in mobile computer hardware, vision-based tracking approaches have the potential to provide efficient solutions that are non-invasive in contrast to the currently dominating marker-based approaches. We propose to use a tracking approach which can use in an unknown environment, i.e. the target has not be known beforehand. The core of the tracker is an on-line learning algorithm, which updates the tracker as new data becomes available. This is suitable in many mobile augmented reality applications. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach on tasks where the target objects are not known beforehand, i.e. interactive planing.},

abstract = {Camera calibration is an essential and important part of an Augmented Reality (AR) system. The use of a planebased calibration technique can give a good accuracy, which can be important for AR applications. The calibration technique used in the current ARToolKit requires user intervention, which is prone to error and involves a lengthy calibration time. The camera has to be recalibrated every time the focal length changes which is cumbersome and less suitable for applications where a more automated and easier approach is needed. This paper investigates the use of camera self-calibration for the ARToolKit, which has the advantage of simplicity of implementation. In order to improve its accuracy, a distortion model is also investigated. In this context several interesting results are presented.},

For this purpose, LabFuture uses real and computer generated objects that are interfaced using mechatronic systems, augmented reality, mobile technologies and 3D multi user environments. The main aim is to develop and demonstrate technological support for practical experiments in the following focused disciplines namely: Fluid Dynamics - Science subject in Germany, Geometry - Mathematics subject in Austria, History and Environmental Awareness Arts and Humanities subjects in Greece and Slovenia. In order to pedagogically enhance the design and functional aspects of this e-learning technology, we are investigating the dialogical operationalisation of learning theories so as to leverage our understanding of teaching and learning practices in the targeted context of deployment. To be able to evaluate the labfuture system in its entire complexity an evaluation methodology including several phases has been developed, performing formative as well as summative evaluations.},

abstract = {Handwriting Recognition enables a person to scribble something on a piece of paper and then convert it into text. If we look into the practical reality there are enumerable styles in which a character may be written. These styles can be self combined to generate more styles. Even if a small child knows the basic styles a character can be written, he would be able to recognize characters written in styles intermediate between them or formed by their mixture. This motivates the use of Genetic Algorithms for the problem. In order to prove this, we made a pool of images of characters. We converted them to graphs. The graph of every character was intermixed to generate styles intermediate between the styles of parent character. Character recognition involved the matching of the graph generated from the unknown character image with the graphs generated by mixing. Using this method we received an accuracy of 98.44\%.},

The technology is used to create a common ground between the organisations and allows the users to interact, plan resources and react to the ongoing events on a digital map. The AR application was developed and evaluated in a study where a forest fire scenario was simulated. Participants from the involved organisations acted as command and control teams in the simulated scenario and both quantitative and qualitative results were obtained. The results show that AR can become a useful tool in these situations in the future.},

We present experimental evidence that if the physical parameters of the simplified virtual system match those of the real system within a certain tolerance, there is a transition from an uncorrelated dual reality state to a mixed reality state of the system in which the motion of the two pendula is highly correlated. The region in parameter space for stable solutions has an Arnold tongue structure for both the experimental data and for a numerical simulation. As virtual systems better approximate real ones, even weak coupling in other interreality systems may produce sudden changes to mixed reality states.},

This concept is extended to bridge multiple user integace dimensions by including multiple users, multiple host platforms, multiple display types, multiple concurrent applications, and a multi-context (i. e., 30 document) integace into a heterogeneous distributed environment. With this architecture, we can explore the user integace design space between pure augmented reality and the popular ubiquitous computing paradigm. We report on our design philosophy centered around the notion of contexts and locales, as well as the underlying sofhare and hardware architecture. Contexts encapsulate a live application together with 30 (visual) and other data, while locales are used to organize geometric reference systems. By separating geometric relationships (locales) from semantic relationships (contexts), we achieve a great amount of flexibility in the configuration of displays. To illustrate our claims, we present several applications including a cinematographic design tool which showcases many features of our system},

We analyze current research, discuss some examples from ultralight light sport aircraft maintenance and show how to apply this framework generically. We present a learning engine to deliver this special type of content and provide a further outlook of future research. A user-centered approach must ensure that the developments can stimulate motivation and enhance performance of the end users in different training sessions. The main benefit is, that the end users are enabled to better perceive complex, technical facts, systems and components.},

abstract = {We present a complete system for live capture of 3D content and simultaneous presentation in augmented reality. The user sees the real world from his viewpoint, but modified so that the image of a remote collaborator is rendered into the scene. Fifteen cameras surround the collaborator, and the resulting video streams are used to construct a three-dimensional model of the subject using a shape-from-silhouette algorithm. Users view a two-dimensional fiducial marker using a video-see-through augmented reality interface. The geometric relationship between the marker and head-mounted camera is calculated, and the equivalent view of the subject is computed and drawn into the scene. Our system can generate 384 288 pixel images of the models at 25 fps, with a latency of < 100 ms. The result gives the strong impression that the subject is a real part of the 3D scene. We demonstrate applications of this system in 3D videoconferencing and entertainment.},

abstract = {A user study was conducted to compare the performance of three methods for map navigation with mobile devices. These methods are joystick navigation, the dynamic peep- hole method without visual context, and the magic lens paradigm using external visual context. The joystick method is the familiar scrolling and panning of a virtual map keep- ing the device itself static. In the dynamic peephole method the device is moved and the map is fixed with respect to an external frame of reference, but no visual information is present outside the devices display. The magic lens method augments an external content with graphical overlays, hence providing visual context outside the device display. Here too motion of the device serves to steer navigation. We compare these methods in a study measuring user performance, mo- tion patterns, and subjective preference via questionnaires. The study demonstrates the advantage of dynamic peephole and magic lens interaction over joystick interaction in terms of search time and degree of exploration of the search space.},

abstract = {Mobile mixed-reality experiences mix physical and digital spaces, enabling participants to simultaneously inhabit a shared environment online and on the streets. These experiences take the form of games, educational applications and new forms of performance and art, and engender new opportunities for interaction, collaboration and play. As mobile mixed-reality experiences move out of the laboratory and into more public settings they raise new challenges concerning how to support these experiences in the wild. This thesis argues that mobile mixed-reality experiences in which artists retain creative control over the content and operation of each experience, particularly those that are deployed as theatrical performances, require dedicated support for content authoring and reactive orchestration tools and paradigms in order to be successfully and robustly operated in public settings. These requirements are examined in detail, drawing on the experience of supporting four publicly toured mobile mixed-reality experiences; Can You See Me Now?, Uncle Roy All Around You, I Like Frank in Adelaide and Savannah, which have provided a platform to practically develop, refine and evaluate new solutions to answer these challenges in the face of presenting the experiences to many thousands of participants over a four year period. This thesis presents two significant supporting frameworks. The ColourMaps system enables designers to author location-based content by directly colouring over maps; providing a simple, familiar and yet highly flexible approach to matching location-triggers to complex physical spaces. It provides support for multiple and specialised content layers, and the ability to configure and manage other aspects of an experience, including filtering inaccurate position data and underpinning orchestration tools. Second, the Orchestration framework supports the day-to-day operation of public experiences; providing dedicated control-room tools for monitoring that reveal the content landscape and historical events, intervention and improvisation techniques for steering and shaping each participant's experience as it unfolds both physically and virtually, and processes to manage a constant flow of participants.},

We propose a real-time system architecture that combines two types of feature tracking. Distinctive image features of the scene are detected and tracked frame-to-frame by computing optical flow. In order to achieve real-time performance, multiple operations are processed in a synchronized multi-threaded manner: capturing a video frame, tracking features using optical flow, detecting distinctive invariant features, and rendering an output frame. We also introduce user interaction methodology for establishing a global coordinate system and for placing virtual objects in the AR environment by tracking a user's outstretched hand and estimating a camera pose relative to it. We evaluate the speed and accuracy of our hybrid feature tracking approach, and demonstrate a proof-of-concept application for enabling AR in unprepared tabletop environments, using bare hands for interaction.},

In the tangible condition, apprentices worked together around an interactive tabletop warehouse simulation using tangible inputs. In the paper condition, they performed the same activity with only paper and pens. Results showed that the tangible condition resulted in better task performance (more alternative solutions explored and better final solution) but did not affect learning outcomes, i.e. understanding of important concepts and applying them to a problem-solving question. We discuss reasons for this in terms of task structure and type, nature of tangible user interfaces and effective interaction requirements.},

The user can explore an environment in a natural way, acquiring local maps in real-time. When revisiting those areas the camera will select the correct local map from store and continue tracking and structural acquisition, while the user views relevant AR constructs registered to that map.

@article{Tian2010,
abstract = {To produce a realistic augmentation in Augmented Reality, the correct relative positions of real objects and virtual objects are very important. In this paper, we propose a novel real-time occlusion handling method based on an object tracking approach. Our method is divided into three steps: selection of the occluding object, object tracking and occlusion handling. The user selects the occluding object using an interactive segmentation method. The contour of the selected object is then tracked in the subsequent frames in real-time. In the occlusion handling step, all the pixels on the tracked object are redrawn on the unprocessed augmented image to produce a new synthesized image in which the relative position between the real and virtual object is correct. The proposed method has several advantages. First, it is robust and stable, since it remains effective when the camera is moved through large changes of viewing angles and volumes or when the object and the background have similar colors. Second, it is fast, since the real object can be tracked in real-time. Last, a smoothing technique provides seamless merging between the augmented and virtual object. Several experiments are provided to validate the performance of the proposed method.},

These include textual descriptions, animated videos, auditory information, images and 3D computer generated objects of related diagrams and designs. An XML interface will allow the teacher to input multimedia information into the database remotely in a simple way. Using an AR interface the content of the database will be visualized in real time using state-of-the-art virtual reality technologies, i.e. head mounted displays, tracking devices, etc. Through this interface, users will be able to interact collaboratively. Using collaborative AR the students will also develop team skills that play a significant role in the learning process.

abstract = {Context: Every interactive system is composed of a functional core and a user interface. However, the software engineering (SE) and human-computer interaction (HCI) communities do not share the same methods, models or tools. This usually induces a large work overhead when specialists from the two domains try to connect their applicative studies, especially when developing augmented reality systems that feature complex interaction cores. Objective: We present in this paper the essential activities and concepts of a development method integrating the SE and HCI development practices, from the specifications down to the design, as well as their application on a case study. Method: The efficiency of the method was tested in a qualitative study involving four pairs of SE and HCI experts in the design of an application for which an augmented reality interaction would provide better user performance than a classic interactive system. The effectivity of the method was evaluated in a qualitative study comparing the quality of three implementations of the same application fragment (based on the same analysis model), using software engineering metrics. Results: The first evaluation confirmed the ease of use of our method and the relevance of our tools for guiding the design process, but raised concerns on the handling of conflicting collaborative activities. The second evaluation gave indications that the structure of the analysis model facilitates the implementation of quality software (in terms of coupling, stability and complexity). Conclusion: It is concluded that our method enables design teams with different backgrounds in application development to collaborate for integrating augmented reality applications with information systems. Areas of improvement are also described. 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {An interactive Multimedia Augmented Reality Interface for E-Learning (MARIE) is presented in the article. Its application for engineering education is discussed in order to enhance traditional teaching and learning methods; however, it is equally applicable to other areas. The authors have developed and implemented a user-friendly interface to experimentally explore the potential of augmented reality by superimposing Virtual Multimedia Content (VMC) information in an Augmented Reality (AR) tabletop environment, such as a student desk workspace. The user can interact with the VMC, which is composed of threedimensional objects, images, animations, text (ASCII or three-dimensional) and sound. To prove the feasibility of the system only a small part of the teaching material was digitised and some experimental results are presented in the article.},

@article{Green2008,
abstract = {Future space exploration will demand the cultivation of human-robotic systems, however, little attention has been paid to the development of human-robot teams. Current methods for autonomous plan creation are often complex and difficult to use. So a system is needed that enables humans and robotic systems to naturally and effectively collaborate. Effective collaboration takes place when the participants are able to communicate in a natural and effective manner. Grounding, the common understanding between conversational participants, shared spatial referencing and situational awareness, are crucial components of communication and collaboration. This paper briefly reviews the fields of human-robot interaction and Augmented Reality (AR), the overlaying of computer graphics onto the real worldview. The strengths of AR are discussed and how they might be used for human-robot collaboration is described. Then a description of an architecture that we have developed is given that uses AR as a means for real time understanding of the shared spatial scene. This architecture enables grounding and enhances situational awareness, thus laying the necessary groundwork for natural and effective human-robot collaboration.},

abstract = {This paper focuses on online scene learning and fast camera relocalisation which are two key problems currently limiting the performance of wide area augmented reality systems. Firstly, we propose to use adaptive random trees to deal with the online scene learning problem. The algorithm can provide more accurate recognition rates than traditional methods, especially with large scale workspaces. Secondly, we use the enhanced PROSAC algorithm to obtain a fast camera relocalisation method. Compared with traditional algorithms, our method can significantly reduce the computation complexity, which facilitates to a large degree the process of online camera relocalisation. Finally, we implement our algorithms in a multithreaded manner by using a parallel-computing scheme. Camera tracking, scene mapping, scene learning and relocalisation are separated into four threads by using multi-CPU hardware architecture. While providing real-time tracking performance, the resulting system also possesses the ability to track multiple maps simultaneously. Some experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the validity of our methods.},

It presents example applications and outlines limitations and solutions for their technical implementation. In MR systems, users perceive both the physical environment around them and digital elements presented through, for example, the use of semitransparent displays. By its very nature, MR is a highly interdisciplinary field engaging signal processing, computer vision, computer graphics, user interfaces, human factors, wearable computing, mobile computing, information visualization, and the design of displays and sensors. This chapter presents potential MR applications, technical challenges in realizing MR systems, as well as issues related to usability and collaboration in MR. It separately presents a section offering a selection of MR projects which have either been partly or fully undertaken at Swiss universities and rounds off with a section on current challenges and trends.},

abstract = {The paper presents an ergonomic analysis carried out in the early phases of an R\&D project. The purpose was to investigate the functioning of today's Automotive Service Technicians (ASTs) training in order to inform the design of an Augmented Reality (AR) teaching aid. The first part of the paper presents a literature review of some major problems encountered by ASTs today. The benefits of AR as technological aid are also introduced. Then, the methodology and the results of two case studies are presented. The first study is based on interviews with trainers and trainees; the second one on observations in real training settings. The results support the assumption that today's ASTs' training could be regarded as a community-of-practice (CoP). Therefore, AR could be useful as a collaboration tool, offering a shared virtual representation of real vehicle's parts, which are normally invisible unless dismantled (e.g. the parts of a hydraulic automatic transmission). We conclude on the methods and the technologies to support the automotive CoP.},

In response to a RANSAC requirement, new results are derived on the minimum number of landmarks needed to obtain a solution, and algorithms are presented for computing these minimum-landmark solutions in closed form.

abstract = {In recent years, the success of single-robot SLAM has led to more multi-robot SLAM (MR-SLAM) research. A team of robots with MR-SLAM can explore an environment more efficiently and reliably; however, MR-SLAM also raises many challenging problems, including map fusion, unknown robot poses and scalability issues. The first two problems can be considered as an optimization problem of finding a consistent joint map based on robots\&x2019; relative poses and sensory data. This optimization problem exhibits a similar property of a singlerobot topological/metric mapping. To exploit this property, we propose a multi-robot SLAM (MR-SLAM) algorithm, which builds a graph-like topological map with vertices representing local metric maps and edges describing relative positions of adjacent local maps. In this MR-SLAM algorithm, the map fusion between two robots can be naturally done by adding an edge that connects two topological maps, and the estimation of relative robot pose is simply performed by optimizing this edge. For the third scalable problem, the proposed algorithm is also scalable to the number of robots and the size of an environment. Computer simulations with a public data set and experimental work on Pioneer 3-DX robots have been conducted to validate the performance of the proposed MR-SLAM algorithm.},

abstract = {The ARIANNA concept utilizes the Ross Ice Shelf near the coast of Antarctica to increase the sensitivity to cosmogenic neutrinos by roughly an order of magnitude when compared to the sensitivity of existing detectors and those under construction. Therefore, ARIANNA can test a wide variety of scenarios for GZK neutrino production, and probe for physics beyond the standard model by measuring the neutrino cross-section at center of momentum energies near 100 TeV. ARIANNA capitalizes on several remarkable properties of the Ross Ice Shelf: shelf ice is relatively transparent to electromagnetic radiation at radio frequencies and the water-ice boundary below the shelf creates a good mirror to reflect radio signals from neutrino interactions in any downward direction. The high sensitivity results from nearly six months of continuous operation, low energy threshold (\~{}3x10\^{}17 eV), and more than 2pi of sky coverage. The baseline concept for ARIANNA consists of moderately high gain antenna stations arranged on a 100 x 100 square grid, separated by about 300m. Each station consists of a small group of cross-polarized antennas residing just beneath the snow surface and facing downwards. They communicate with a central control hub by wireless links to generate global triggers.},

We proposed a Gaussian Predication Model on the basis of the latest vanishing point to predicate the current VP, and we constructed an objective function including the linear segment intensity and the predicated VP, subsequently the optimal position of the VP is estimated through the least square method. The computational complexity of the estimation algorithm is 0(n), which can operate in real time. We test our algorithm on many structured road and semi-structured road images, the results show that it can robustly determine the VP position regardless the disturbance of around pedestrian, crowd and vehicles. Moreover, experiments on PETS2001 dataset show its application to the road lane detection for the driver assistant system. 2006 IEEE.},

The framework is based on two types of a priori information: (1) the contextual information of the cameras FOV, in terms of the description of the different static objects of the scene and (2) sets of predefined behavior scenarios, which need to be analyzed in different contexts. At present the system is designed to recognize behavior from stored videos and retrieve the frames in which the specific behaviors took place. We demonstrate successful behavior recognition results for pedestrian-vehicle interaction and vehicle-checkpost interactions.},

The method is tested on numerous problem instances of both synthetic and real data sets. In the vast majority of cases we are able to verify that the solutions are optimal, in particular for small-scale problems. We also develop a branch and bound procedure that goes beyond verification. In cases where the sufficient condition does not hold, the algorithm returns either of the following two results: (i) a certificate of global optimality for the local solution or (ii) the global solution.},

abstract = {Image analysis and computer vision can be effectively employed to recover the three-dimensional structure of imaged objects, together with their surface properties. In this paper, we address the problem of metric reconstruction and texture acquisition from a single uncalibrated view of a surface of revolution (SOR). Geometric constraints induced in the image by the symmetry properties of the SOR structure are exploited to perform self-calibration of a natural camera, 3D metric reconstruction, and texture acquisition. By exploiting the analogy with the geometry of single axis motion, we demonstrate that the imaged apparent contour and the visible segments of two imaged cross sections in a single SOR view provide enough information for these tasks. Original contributions of the paper are: single view self-calibration and reconstruction based on planar rectification, previously developed for planar surfaces, has been extended to deal also with the SOR class of curved surfaces; self-calibration is obtained by estimating both camera focal length (one parameter) and principal point (two parameters) from three independent linear constraints for the SOR fixed entities; the invariant-based description of the SOR scaling function has been extended from affine to perspective projection. The solution proposed exploits both the geometric and topological properties of the transformation that relates the apparent contour to the SOR scaling function. Therefore, with this method, a metric localization of the SOR occluded parts can be made, so as to cope with them correctly. For the reconstruction of textured SORs, texture acquisition is performed without requiring the estimation of external camera calibration parameters, but only using internal camera parameters obtained from self-calibration.},

The rectification allows metric properties, such as angles and length ratios, to be measured on the world plane from a perspective image. The novel contributions are: first, that in a stratified context the various forms of providing metric information, which include a known angle, two equal though unknown angles, and a known length ratio; can all be represented as circular constraints on the parameters of an affine transformation of the plane-this provides a simple and uniform framework for integrating constraints; second, direct rectification from right angles in the plane; third, it is shown that metric rectification enables calibration of the internal camera parameters; fourth, vanishing points are estimated using a Maximum Likelihood estimator; fifth, an algorithm for automatic rectification. Examples are given for a number of images, and applications demonstrated for texture map acquisition and metric measurements},

In this paper, we combine edge detection with road area extraction to solve this problem. Our method works well even on noisy campus road whose boundaries are blurred with sidewalks and surface is often covered with unbalanced sunlight. First, segmentation is done and the segments which belong to road are chosen and merged. Second, we use Hough transform and a voting method to get the vanishing point. Then, the boundaries are searched according to the road shape. We also employ prediction to make our method achieve better performance in video sequence. Our method is fast enough to meet real-time requirement. Experiments were carried out on the intelligent vehicle SpringRobot (Fig. 1) on campus roads, which is a good representation of urban environment.},

abstract = {Vanishing point detection algorithms based on a Gaussian sphere representation have been employed in a variety of computer vision systems, for extracting 3D line orientations as a first step towards object detection. Typically, these algorithms have been applied to imagery with strong perspective effects and with little noise or texture, resulting in good solutions for line orientations. However, these algorithms can fail if perspective effects are weak, or if texture edges are predominant; they also fail to take advantage of knowledge about the objects to be detected. In this paper, two new techniques for robust vanishing point detection on the Gaussian sphere are presented; primitive-based vanishing point analysis and interpretation plane error modeling. The performance of these methods, along with two other existing methods from the literature, are quantitatively evaluated and compared for the task of building detection in complex aerial imagery},

The vision component uses Gabor wavelet filters for texture analysis to find ruts and tracks from which the road vanishing point can be inferred via Hough-style voting, yielding a direction estimate for steering control. The ladar component projects detected obstacles along the road direction onto the plane of the front of the vehicle and tracks the 1-D obstacle "gap" presumed due to the road to yield a lateral offset estimate. Several image- and state-based tests to detect failure conditions such as off-road poses (i.e., there is no road to follow) and poor lighting due to sun glare or distracting shadows are also explained. The system's efficacy is demonstrated with analysis of diverse logged data including from the 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge, as well as tests with full control of a vehicle over 15 km of difficult roads at up to 37 km/h with no waypoints. 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {For Gaussian regression, we develop and analyze methods for combining estimators from various models. For squared-error loss, an unbiased estimator of the risk of the mixture of general estimators is developed. Special attention is given to the case that the component estimators are least-squares projections into arbitrary linear subspaces, such as those spanned by subsets of explanatory variables in a given design. We relate the unbiased estimate of the risk of the mixture estimator to estimates of the risks achieved by the components. This results in simple and accurate bounds on the risk and its estimate, in the form of sharp and exact oracle inequalities. That is, without advance knowledge of which model is best, the resulting performance is comparable to or perhaps even superior to what is achieved by the best of the individual models. Furthermore, in the case that the unknown parameter has a sparse representation, our mixture estimator adapts to the underlying sparsity. Simulations show that the performance of these mixture estimators is better than that of a related model-selection estimator which picks a model with the highest weight. Also, the connection between our mixtures with Bayes procedures is discussed.},

abstract = {The problem of a real-time pose estimation between a 3D scene and a single camera is a fundamental task in most 3D computer vision and robotics applications such as object tracking, visual servoing, and virtual reality. In this paper we present two fast methods for estimating the 3D pose using 2D to 3D point and line correspondences. The first method is based on the iterative use of a weak perspective camera model and forms a generalization of DeMenthon's method (1995) which consists of determining the pose from point correspondences. In this method the pose is iteratively improved with a weak perspective camera model and at convergence the computed pose corresponds to the perspective camera model. The second method is based on the iterative use of a paraperspective camera model which is a first order approximation of perspective. We describe in detail these two methods for both non-planar and planar objects. Experiments involving synthetic data as well as real range data indicate the feasibility and robustness of these two methods. We analyse the convergence of these methods and we conclude that the iterative paraperspective method has better convergence properties than the iterative weak perspective method. We also introduce a non-linear optimization method for solving the pose problem. (C) 1999 Academic Press.},

We formulate the problem as minimization of the lateral displacement between single projected image lines and their vanishing points. Unlike previous vanishing point methods, parallel line pairs are not required. Additionally, the invariance properties of vanishing points mean that multiple images related by pure translation can be used to increase the calibration data set size without increasing the number of estimated parameters. We compare this method with vanishing point methods and the Gold Standard algorithm and demonstrate that it has comparable performance.},

The main technical contributions of the proposed approach are a novel adaptive soft voting scheme based on variable-sized voting region using confidence-weighted Gabor filters, which compute the dominant texture orientation at each pixel, and a new vanishingpoint- constrained edge detection technique for detecting road boundaries. The proposed method has been implemented, and experiments with 1003 general road images demonstrate that it is both computationally efficient and effective at detecting road regions in challenging conditions.},

abstract = {In central catadioptric systems, lines in a scene are projected to conic curves in the image. This work studies the geometry of the central catadioptric projection of lines and its use in calibration. It is shown that the conic curves where the lines are mapped possess several projective invariant properties. From these properties, it follows that any central catadioptric system can be fully calibrated from an image of three or more lines. The image of the absolute conic, the relative pose between the camera and the mirror, and the shape of the reflective surface can be recovered using a geometric construction based on the conic loci where the lines are projected. This result is valid for any central catadioptric system and generalizes previous results for paracatadioptric sensors. Moreover, it is proven that systems with a hyperbolic/elliptical mirror can be calibrated from the image of two lines. If both the shape and the pose of the mirror are known, then two line images are enough to determine the image of the absolute conic encoding the camera's intrinsic parameters. The sensitivity to errors is evaluated and the approach is used to calibrate a real camera.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a simple and discriminative framework, using graphical model and 3D geometry to understand the diversity of urban scenes with varying viewpoints. Our algorithm constructs a conditional random field (CRF) network using over-segmented superpixels and learns the appearance model from different set of features for specific classes of our interest. Also, we introduce a training algorithm to learn a model for edge potential among these superpixel areas based on their feature difference. The proposed algorithm gives competitive and visually pleasing results for urban scene segmentation. We show the inference from our trained network improves the class labeling performance compared to the result when using the appearance model solely.},

abstract = {This paper presents a method for extracting distinctive invariant features from images that can be used to perform reliable matching between different views of an object or scene. The features are invariant to image scale and rotation, and are shown to provide robust matching across a substantial range of affine distortion, change in 3D viewpoint, addition of noise, and change in illumination. The features are highly distinctive, in the sense that a single feature can be correctly matched with high probability against a large database of features from many images. This paper also describes an approach to using these features for object recognition. The recognition proceeds by matching individual features to a database of features from known objects using a fast nearest-neighbor algorithm, followed by a Hough transform to identify clusters belonging to a single object, and finally performing verification through least-squares solution for consistent pose parameters. This approach to recognition can robustly identify objects among clutter and occlusion while achieving near real-time performance.},

abstract = {New sensor technologies for homeland security applications must meet the key requirements of sensitivity to detect agents below risk levels, selectivity to provide minimal false-alarm rates, and response speed to operate in high throughput environments, such as airports, sea ports, and other public places. Chemical detection using existing sensor systems is facing a major challenge of selectivity. In this review, we provide a brief summary of chemical threats of homeland security importance; focus in detail on modern concepts in chemical sensing; examine the origins of the most significant unmet needs in existing chemical sensors; and, analyze opportunities, specific requirements, and challenges for wireless chemical sensors and wireless sensor networks (WSNs). We further review a new approach for selective chemical sensing that involves the combination of a sensing material that has different response mechanisms to different species of interest, with a transducer that has a multi-variable signal-transduction ability. This new selective chemical-sensing approach was realized using an attractive ubiquitous platform of battery-free passive radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags adapted for chemical sensing. We illustrate the performance of RFID sensors developed in measurements of toxic industrial materials, humidity-independent detection of toxic vapors, and detection of chemical-agent simulants, explosives, and strong oxidizers.},

abstract = {During nuclear accidents, when radioactive materials spread into the environment, the people in the affected areas should evacuate immediately. However, few information systems are available regarding escape guidelines for nuclear accidents. Therefore, this study constructs escape guidelines on mobile phones. This application is called Mobile Escape Guidelines (MEG) and adopts two techniques. One technique is the geographical information that offers multiple representations; the other is the augmented reality that provides semi-realistic information services. When this study tested the mobile escape guidelines, the results showed that this application was capable of identifying the correct locations of users, showing the escape routes, filtering geographical layers, and rapidly generating the relief reports. Users could evacuate from nuclear accident sites easily, even without relief personnel, since using slim devices to access the mobile escape guidelines is convenient. Overall, this study is a useful reference for a nuclear accident emergency response.},

@book{Bishop2006,
abstract = {The dramatic growth in practical applications for machine learning over the last ten years has been accompanied by many important developments in the underlying algorithms and techniques. For example, Bayesian methods have grown from a specialist niche to become mainstream, while graphical models have emerged as a general framework for describing and applying probabilistic techniques. The practical applicability of Bayesian methods has been greatly enhanced by the development of a range of approximate inference algorithms such as variational Bayes and expectation propagation, while new models based on kernels have had a significant impact on both algorithms and applications. This completely new textbook reflects these recent developments while providing a comprehensive introduction to the fields of pattern recognition and machine learning. It is aimed at advanced undergraduates or first-year PhD students, as well as researchers and practitioners. No previous knowledge of pattern recognition or machine learning concepts is assumed. Familiarity with multivariate calculus and basic linear algebra is required, and some experience in the use of probabilities would be helpful though not essential as the book includes a self-contained introduction to basic probability theory. The book is suitable for courses on machine learning, statistics, computer science, signal processing, computer vision, data mining, and bioinformatics. Extensive support is provided for course instructors, including more than 400 exercises, graded according to difficulty. Example solutions for a subset of the exercises are available from the book web site, while solutions for the remainder can be obtained by instructors from the publisher. The book is supported by a great deal of additional material, and the reader is encouraged to visit the book web site for the latest information. A forthcoming companion volume will deal with practical aspects of pattern recognition and machine learning, and will include free software implementations of the key algorithms along with example data sets and demonstration programs. Christopher Bishop is Assistant Director at Microsoft Research Cambridge, and also holds a Chair in Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh. He is a Fellow of Darwin College Cambridge, and was recently elected Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering. The author's previous textbook "Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition" has been widely adopted.},
